This dissertation would not have been possible without the help and guidance of many.

First, I would like to express my gratitude to my chair, Dr. Michael White, and the rest of my committee: Dr. Alyssa Chamberlain, Dr. Jacob Young, and Dr. Brandon del Pozo. Alyssa, thank you for constantly pushing me to improve. Jacob, thank you for the many impromptu conversations about the dissertation, methodological approaches, and \textit{R}. Brandon, your insights and feedback throughout this process have profoundly reshaped my perspective on the opioid overdose crisis and police involvement—thank you.

Mike, I first reached out to you on September 23, 2019, hoping you would bring me onto the Tempe Opioid Recovery Project. As a first-year Master's student, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect. I was generally interested in policing but had only a surface-level knowledge of the opioid overdose crisis. Nonetheless, you agreed to include me in the project, and the rest is history. Reaching out to you turned out to be one of the best decisions I have made. Thank you for the countless opportunities, training, and guidance. You have been an extraordinary mentor, and I hope my work over the past five years, culminating in this dissertation, has made you proud. Thank you!

Second, thank you to Dr. Danielle Wallace and Dr. Shi Yan for our frequent chats about statistics, \textit{Stata}, data management, and much more. Your support and insights over the years have undoubtedly influenced various aspects of this dissertation.

Third, I would like to thank those from the Tempe Police Department: Sergeant Rob Ferraro, (Ret.) Officer Dave Hanson, and Officer Aaron Williams; and from La Frontera EMPACT: Dennis Douglas. I appreciate not only your innovative thinking but also our discussions about the project, which have been invaluable to this dissertation.

Lastly, to my colleagues—Jake, Olivia, Dennis, Gerald, Daniela, Kelsey, Kathryn, Laura, and Matt—thank you! The dissertation journey requires good friends and colleagues with whom to share coffee, or perhaps an occasional drink. At one point or another, I’ve asked each of you to brainstorm with me on this dissertation, and each of you has answered the call. Thank you all; this dissertation would have been far more challenging without your support.
