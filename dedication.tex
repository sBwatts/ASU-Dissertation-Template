To my mom and dad, thank you for everything. Your unwavering dedication, love, and the time you spent shaping me into who I am today have been invaluable to this journey. I know I didn’t end up playing professional baseball, but I hope a PhD will do! Your belief in me, even from a young age, has been a constant source of strength and motivation.

To my wife, there are not enough ways to say thank you. Your steadfast support through my five years of graduate school has not gone unnoticed. You’ve been my source of calm and encouragement, standing by me through every challenge and triumph. I couldn’t have done this without you.
