%   start listing appendices in the TOC,
                                        %   subsequent TOC pages should use "APPENDIX in
                                        %   the header instead of "CHAPTER"; however,
                                        %   this code will make "APPENDIX" appear on the

                                        %   appears on. This problem won't affect most
                                        %   people, but if it affects you, uncomment
                                        %   these lines and move them below where
                                        %   the appendices are listed. Keep moving these
