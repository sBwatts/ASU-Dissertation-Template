	abstract = {For repeat drug offenders, homelessness, unemployment, and lack of access to legitimate income and benefits are obstacles to community integration and quality-of-life improvement. Seattle’s Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) is a collaborative, prebooking diversion program that provides individuals suspected of low-level drug and prostitution offenses with legal assistance and harm reduction–oriented case management instead of prosecution and incarceration. We conducted this single-arm, within-subjects study to test changes in participants’ housing, employment, and income/benefits both prior and subsequent to their LEAD program referral. Findings indicated significant within-subjects improvements for LEAD participants ( N = 176) across all outcomes of interest. Moreover, achieving housing and employment was associated with 17\% and 33\% fewer arrests during the follow-up, respectively.},

	abstract = {Background: Law enforcement agencies in the US have provided naloxone to officers and devel­ oped initiatives to follow-up after a non-fatal overdose. However, the prevalence and characteristics of these efforts have yet to be documented in research literature.
Objectives: We sought to understand the national prevalence of naloxone provision among law enforcement and examine the implementation of post-overdose follow-up.
Methods: We administered a survey on drug overdose response initiatives using a multimodal approach (online and mail) to a nationally representative sample of law enforcement agencies (N = 2,009; 50.1\% response rate) drawn from the National Directory of Law Enforcement Administrators database. We further examine a subsample of agencies (N = 1,514) that equipped officers with naloxone who were also asked about post-overdose follow-up.
Results: We found 81.7\% of agencies reported officers were equipped with naloxone; among these, approximately one-third (30.3\%) reported follow-up after an overdose. More than half (56.8\%) of agencies indicated partnership in follow-up with emergency medical services as the most common partner (68.8\%). There were 21.4\% of agencies with a Quick Response Team, a popular national post-overdose model, and were more likely to indicate partnership with a substance use disorder treatment provider than when agencies were asked generally about partners in follow-up (74.5\% and 26.2\% respectively).
Conclusion: Many law enforcement agencies across the US have equipped officers with naloxone, and about one-third of those are conducting follow-up to non-fatal overdose events. Post-overdose follow-up models and practices vary in ways that can influence treatment engagement and minimize harms against persons who use drugs.},

	abstract = {This paper meta-analyzes 12 heterogeneous studies that examine bias in the comparative interrupted time-series design (CITS) that is often used to evaluate the effects of social policy interventions. To measure bias, each CITS impact estimate was differenced from the estimate derived from a theoretically unbiased causal benchmark study that tested the same hypothesis with the same treatment group, outcome data, and estimand. In 10 studies, the benchmark was a randomized experiment and in the other two it was a regression-discontinuity study. Analyses revealed the average standardized CITS bias to be between −0.01 and 0.042 standard deviations; and all but one bias estimate from individual studies fell within 0.10 standard deviations of its benchmark, indicating that the near zero mean bias did not result from averaging many large single study differences. The low mean and generally tight distribution of individual bias estimates suggest that CITS studies are worth recommending for future causal hypothesis tests because: (1) over the studies examined, they generally resulted in high internal validity; and (2) they also promise high external validity because the empirical tests we synthesized occurred across a wide variety of settings, times, interventions, and outcomes.},

Although most Black Americans are afraid of the police, most also prefer to maintain (or increase) local police presence and spending. Are these paradoxical policy preferences artifacts of the questions used in Gallup and Pew polls—questions that fail to disentangle assumptions about trends in crime and police reform? We tested this experimentally using a nationwide survey (N = 1,100) with comparable numbers of Black (N = 511) and non-Black (N = 589) respondents. We found that Black Americans’ policing preferences were robust—if anything, they were more robust than those of non-Black Americans. Most Black Americans said that even if crime was declining and new police reforms were not enacted, they would still prefer to maintain (or increase) police patrols and spending. Both fear of police and perceived procedural justice predicted policy preferences, regardless of respondents’ race.},

	abstract = {Police officers are stationed on the frontlines of open-air drug markets and regularly intervene in issues resulting from public drug consumption and overdoses. Police departments are increasingly being asked to adopt harm reduction approaches to deal with the health and safety consequences of drug use. As officer buy-in is essential to intervention success, it is important to assess officer attitudes towards their evolving duties. This study draws on over 400 hours of field observation data with transit officers deployed on an overdose rapid response programme in Philadelphia’s Kensington neighbourhood. Generally, officers were supportive of Narcan for overdose reversal, but some pointed out limitations to its use. Officers also identified how widespread availability of Narcan has changed the local overdose landscape and community response. Officers expressed mixed opinions towards ancillary support via food and clothing distribution by local organisations. They were more supportive of long-term treatment efforts though recognised the rarity of treatment initiation. Findings illuminate a tension in contemporary policing as officers rely less on law enforcement and adapt to harm reduction approaches in their daily work. Their perspectives identify potential benefits to enhanced training and understanding of harm reduction principles among police officers.},

Responding officers displayed fairly serious and punitive attitudes toward drug offenses. In addition, they reported an interventionist attitude, believing that more can and should be done to control drug activity. Individual officer characteristics, such as education attainment and political ideology, were more strongly associated with drug attitudes than law enforcement indicators, such as rank and experience with the vice/narcotics unit.},

Carceral state scholars have investigated how and why policymakers have treated so many social problems as policing problems, but they have not yet recognized the degree to which the call-for-service system has marginalized political control over police strategy. This Article traces the historical sources of this arrangement through extensive archival research into its evolution. We find that over the course of the twentieth century, the rise of new communications technologies gradually shifted the power to decide which problems are proper subjects of police attention to private individuals, eventually channeling their demands through centralized call centers that had been stripped of the authority and contextual knowledge needed to govern them in a meaningful way. That process fundamentally altered the character of public oversight over policing, elevating a distinctive set of individual interests as largely unchallenged determinants of the kinds of situations that are policeable. By illustrating how sociotechnical change unintentionally reallocated the authority to define the scope of an important institution’s mandate, this case sheds new light on the factors that shape the police role and the role the public plays in defining it.},

However, “fuck” can also be used derogatorily, and negatively impact public assessments of police actions. Policy in this area is either absent, overly broad, or inappropriate to its intended use. Following brief, unstructured interviews with line and executive officers, I propose a novel policy theory of profanity, deriving target and intent. I test the theory with a pre-registered experiment administered to a national sample of police and human resources executives (n = 1492), with each respondent evaluating multiple vignettes (n = 5280 observations). Results support the proposed theory and generate useful recommendations for practitioners interested in strengthening the ability of agencies to constrain professionally inappropriate use of profanity in the police workplace.},

Using stratified random sampling, we surveyed 248 officers from 27 Illinois police departments on their knowledge of addiction and the means to address it. We performed descriptive and regression analyses to examine differences based on officer characteristics. We found a high proportion of officers lacked knowledge of addiction, treatment, and harm reduction. Our findings suggest the need for police training to improve understanding of addiction.

	abstract = {The devastating impact of the current opioid overdose crisis has led to new involvement of law enforcement officers. Training programs have focused on overdose recognition and response without targeting core attitudinal change by covering addiction or harm reduction principles. This study examined the impact of a comprehensive overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training on officers’ attitudes toward overdose victims, knowledge of and competence to respond to an opioid overdose, and concerns about using naloxone. The training included the common information about overdose recognition and response, with added components covering broader content about addiction and harm reduction principles and philosophies. A total of 787 (83\% male) officers were administered surveys before and after attending a 2.5–3 hour comprehensive OEND training. Survey items measured overdose-related knowledge and attitudes, including attitudes about people who use drugs and who overdose. Following the training, participants’ overdose-related knowledge and perceived competence to use naloxone improved. However, there were more nuanced changes in attitudes toward overdose victims: though 55.3\% of officers reported more positive post-training attitudes, 31\% reported more negative attitudes, and 13.7\% reported no attitudinal change. Younger officers were most likely to report worsened attitudes. Improvements in attitudes toward overdose victims were associated with reductions in both naloxone-related concerns and risk compensation beliefs. Despite a comprehensive OEND training that addressed addiction and harm reduction and directly targeted hypothesized drivers of negative attitudes (e.g., risk compensation beliefs), some officers’ attitudes worsened after the training. Randomized experiments of different training approaches would elucidate the mediators and moderators underlying these unexpected responses.},

Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method’s assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.},

	abstract = {Background: Our objective was to examine the temporal relationship between COVID-19 infections among prison staff, incarcerated individuals, and the general population in the county where the prison is located among federal prisons in the United States. Methods: We employed population-standardized regressions with fixed effects for prisons to predict the number of active cases of COVID-19 among incarcerated persons using data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for the months of March to December in 2020 for 63 prisons. Results: There is a significant relationship between the COVID-19 prevalence among staff, and through them, the larger community, and COVID-19 prevalence among incarcerated persons in the US federal prison system. When staff rates are low or at zero, COVID-19 incidence in the larger community continues to have an association with COVID-19 prevalence among incarcerated persons, suggesting possible pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission by staff. Masking policies slightly reduced COVID-19 prevalence among incarcerated persons, though the association between infections among staff, the community, and incarcerated persons remained significant and strong. Conclusion: The relationship between COVID-19 infections among staff and incarcerated persons shows that staff is vital to infection control, and correctional administrators should also focus infection containment efforts on staff, in addition to incarcerated persons.},

Officers retain significant discretionary authority in their response to these encounters. To explore the factors that underlie these decisions, we surveyed a sample of Illinois police officers. We administered an online survey to Illinois police departments using a random sampling strategy, stratified by agency size and the rurality of their service areas. Our final sample was 248 police officers from 27 departments. We surveyed officers’ beliefs about (1) influences and control over their decision making; (2) the approval of other actors in making referrals to treatment for addiction, and (3) the potential impacts of medication-assisted treatment (MAT). We analyzed the survey data using descriptive statistics and regression analyses. Most officers were highly influenced by the expectations of their supervisors when responding to subjects who appeared to have an OUD, and about half would take direction from addiction treatment providers. Police in urban departments perceived greater support for MAT and were more likely to believe MAT could reduce the need for future arrests. Our findings suggest ways police officers can be influenced to make discretionary decisions that improve the health outcomes of their encounters with people with OUD: (1) Supervisors should serve as champions to promote referrals to treatment for substance use disorders; (2) collaboration between law enforcement and community addiction treatment providers should be strengthened, and (3) MAT should be supported and expanded in rural areas.},

	abstract = {Objectives. To describe all-outcome injurious shootings by police and compare characteristics of fatal versus nonfatal injurious shootings nationally.
Methods. From July 2021 to April 2023, we manually reviewed publicly available records on all 2015–2020 injurious shootings by US police, identiﬁed from Gun Violence Archive. We estimated injury frequency, case fatality rates, and relative odds of death by incident and victim characteristics.
Results. A total of 1769 people were injured annually in shootings by police, 55\% fatally. When a shooting injury occurred, odds of fatality were 46\% higher following dispatched responses than policeinitiated responses. Injuries associated with physically threatening or threat-making behaviors, behavioral health needs, and well-being checks were most frequently fatal. Relative to White victims, Black victims were overrepresented but had 35\% lower odds of fatal injury when shot.
Conclusions. This ﬁrst multiyear, nationwide analysis of injurious shootings by US police suggests that injury disparities are underestimated by fatal shootings alone. Nonpolicing responses to social needs may prevent future injuries. Public Health Implications. We call for enhanced reporting systems, comprehensive evaluation of emerging reforms, and targeted investment in social services for equitable injury prevention.

This has the advantage that selection bias and confounding due to between-group differences are limited. However, the basic interrupted time series design cannot exclude confounding due to co-interventions or other events occurring around the time of the intervention. One approach to minimizse potential confounding from such simultaneous events is to add a control series so that there is both a before-after comparison and an intervention-control group comparison. A range of different types of controls can be used with interrupted time series designs, each of which has associated strengths and limitations. Researchers undertaking controlled interrupted time series studies should carefully consider a priori what confounding events may exist and whether different controls can exclude these or if they could introduce new sources of bias to the study. A prudent approach to the design, analysis and interpretation of controlled interrupted time series studies is required to ensure that valid information on the effectiveness of health interventions can be ascertained.},

Analyzing data from interviews with 44 male residents, our study examines the characteristics of RHU residents’ innovation. Our findings show these innovative behaviors are characterized by the number of actors, the communication style of the behavior, and the degree of violence.

            Recent calls from senior managers, human rights groups and academics continue to scrutinize the impact of solitary confinement. But much less attention has been paid to prisoners’ own motivations for segregation. By analysing interviews with 16 segregated men in a high-security prison (Category-A) in England, this article foregrounds motivation. The argument involves a detailed description of the complex, and sometimes contradictory, motives that may lead prisoners into seeking isolation. It further attempts to explore the relationship between segregation and the wider prison environment. For many prisoners, segregation has a ‘negative benefit’ or amounts to a form of ‘lesser evil’. Such phrasing hints at the difficult decisions that prisoners navigate and offers an alternative perspective on solitary confinement.},

	doi = {10.21428/cb6ab371.dfc6b8fa},
	abstract = {Objectives: This study addresses the significant challenge of estimating statistical power for experiments involving rare but impactful events, where traditional power analysis models, assuming normal distribution, inadequately estimate required sample sizes. It introduces a simulation framework leveraging Poisson regression models to better capture the dynamics of rare event occurrences and their impact on power calculations.
Methods: Using Poisson distributions, a comprehensive simulation framework systematically assesses the interplay between sample size, effect size, and event occurrence rates. This approach is calibrated against realworld criminological constraints to ensure relevance and applicability. A key innovation is the "power lift" metric, devised to provide a more stable estimation of the required sample sizes by addressing the inherent instability in power simulations for rare events.
Results: The simulation reveals intricate relationships between effect size, sample size, and event rates, underscoring the challenge of achieving sufficient statistical power in studies of rare events. The "power lift" metric emerges as a robust tool for determining sample size requirements, offering greater stability across various scenarios. Results are operationalized through user-friendly simulation code and a quick reference table, providing practical tools for researchers.
Conclusions: The study advances a methodological framework for power analysis in the context of rare events in criminology. By integrating the "power lift" metric and a Poisson regression-based simulation framework, it offers researchers a more accurate and reliable means of estimating sample sizes for statistically robust investigations into rare but socially significant events.},

While prior work emphasizes the technological features driving public opinion, we investigate how public trust and support for AI in government vary with the institutional context. We administer a pre-registered survey experiment to 4200 respondents about AI use cases in policing to measure responsiveness to three key institutional factors: bureaucratic proximity (i.e., local sheriff versus national Federal Bureau of Investigation), algorithmic targets (i.e., public targets via predictive policing versus detecting officer misconduct through automated case review), and agency capacity (i.e., necessary resources and expertise). We find that the public clearly prefers local over national law enforcement use of AI, while reactions to different algorithmic targets are more limited and politicized. However, we find no responsiveness to agency capacity or lack thereof. The findings suggest the need for greater scholarly, practitioner, and public attention to organizational, not only technical, prerequisites for successful government implementation of AI.},

Results from over 1,300 police executives reveal that law enforcement leaders are responsive to peer adoption but much less to public opinion, despite overwhelming public support.

            Diversification is a widely proposed policing reform, but its impact is difficult to assess. We used records of millions of daily patrol assignments, determined through fixed rules and preassigned rotations that mitigate self-selection, to compare the average behavior of officers of different demographic profiles working in comparable conditions. Relative to white officers, Black and Hispanic officers make far fewer stops and arrests, and they use force less often, especially against Black civilians. These effects are largest in majority-Black areas of Chicago and stem from reduced focus on enforcing low-level offenses, with greatest impact on Black civilians. Female officers also use less force than males, a result that holds within all racial groups. These results suggest that diversity reforms can improve police treatment of minority communities.},

              Does a victim's race explain variation in the likelihood of homicide clearance? Attempts to address this issue date back to the 1970s. Yet, despite its theoretical and policy relevance, we lack a comprehensive and clear empirical answer to this critical question. Here, I causally focus on this problem by investigating racial disparity in homicide clearance in the United States, exploiting two sources covering the 1991–2020 period: the Murder Accountability Project data set (
              N
              = 522,278) and the National Incident‐Based Reporting System data set (
              N
              = 98,677). I primarily analyze these sources by employing exact matching to achieve perfect covariate balance and subsequently isolate the effect of race on the probability of clearance. For comparative purposes, I also use regression adjustment without matching obtaining complementary estimates. I demonstrate that the likelihood of clearance is 3.4 to 4.8 percent lower for homicides involving Black victims, depending on the sampling and estimation approach. In addition, I empirically show that this race effect is slightly higher for males and that racial disparity has moderately but significantly increased over time. These findings contribute to the extensive amount of evidence on discrimination affecting Black individuals in the administration of justice in the United States, calling for structural efforts to reduce this divide.},

	abstract = {Two modeling approaches are commonly used to estimate the associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual-level health outcomes in multilevel studies (subjects within neighborhoods). Random effects models (or mixed models) use maximum likelihood estimation. Population average models typically use a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. These methods are used in place of basic regression approaches because the health of residents in the same neighborhood may be correlated, thus violating independence assumptions made by traditional regression procedures. This violation is particularly relevant to estimates of the variability of estimates. Though the literature appears to favor the mixed-model approach, little theoretical guidance has been offered to justify this choice. In this paper, we review the assumptions behind the estimates and inference provided by these 2 approaches. We propose a perspective that treats regression models for what they are in most circumstances: reasonable approximations of some true underlying relationship. We argue in general that mixed models involve unveriﬁable assumptions on the datagenerating distribution, which lead to potentially misleading estimates and biased inference. We conclude that the estimation-equation approach of population average models provides a more useful approximation of the truth.},

Results from a simulation study are reported which aimed at obtaining guidelines on appropriate sample sizes. We focused on a situation where linear growth occurs at the organizational level, and organizational growth is predicted by a single organizational level variable. The power to identify an effect of this organizational level variable was moderately to strongly positively related to number of measurement occasions, number of groups, group size, intraclass correlation, effect size, and growth curve reliability. The Type I error rate was close to the nominal alpha level under all conditions.},

            Parole is one of the least visible decision-making processes in the criminal justice system. We consider decision statements that support or reject release as symbolic of organizational concerns beyond the candidate’s individual attributes. To draw out the symbolic, we focus on decision statements issued to 33 juvenile lifers previously ineligible for parole. We find that what is meaningful to a parole board is highly selective, and there is no generalized presumption of mitigated culpability and capacity for rehabilitation. Rather release is justified based on childhood abuse, peer dependency and a redemptive self. In contrast, denying narratives selectively highlight the seriousness of the sentencing offence by focusing on the ‘horrific,’ and the retributive requirement for more time to be served.},

            Recent studies of long-term imprisonment describe a largely invariant pattern of prisoner adaptation. Using data from a qualitative study of men serving life sentences in England, I argue that adaptation may in fact vary more than these studies imply both because of the prisoner’s age when sentenced and because of the circumstances of particular offences. Participants’ engagement with the prison’s rehabilitative ‘offer’ depended on how the sentence affected their life course and what they understood to be the moral ramifications of the offence. These findings refine understanding of adaptation and suggest that a renewed focus on moral reflexivity may bear fruit in future prison research.},

Using principal stratification in a causal mediation framework, we derive the exact form of the statistical bias that results from traditional estimation. We develop a bias-correction procedure and nonparametric sharp bounds for race effects, replicate published findings, and show the traditional estimator can severely underestimate levels of racially biased policing or mask discrimination entirely.

Specifically, we conducted an original survey experiment to determine whether research information treatments influence respondents’ views on the effectiveness of the police in reducing crime, defunding and refunding police budgets, and use of body-worn cameras. Our results indicated that presenting confirmatory research information had a significant positive impact on perceptions of police effectiveness in reducing crime and use of body-worn cameras compared to comparison groups. Conversely, presenting “negative” research information had a significant negative effect on these perceptions. Interestingly, neither positive nor negative research information treatments related to defunding versus refunding the police had a statistically significant impact on respondents compared to comparison groups, suggesting that research findings have limited effects on more ideologically complex policing topics.},

	abstract = {Careful reading of the literature on the psychology of criminal conduct and of prior reviews of studies of treatment effects suggests that neither criminal sanctioning without provision of rehabilitative service nor servicing without reference to clinical principles of rehabilitation will succeed in reducing recidivism. What works, in our view, is the delivery of appropriate correctional service, and appropriate service reflects three psychological principles: (1) delivery of service to higher risk cases, (2) targeting of criminogenic needs, and (3) use of styles and modes of treatment (e.g., cognitive and behavioral) that are matched with client need and learning styles. These principles were applied to studies of juvenile and adult correctional treatment, which yielded 154 phi coefficients that summarized the magnitude and direction of the impact of treatment on recidivism. The effect of appropriate correctional service (mean phi = .30) was significantly (p {\textless}.05) greater than that of unspecified correctional service (.13), and both were more effective than inappropriate service (−.06) and non‐service criminal sanctioning (−.07). Service was effective within juvenile and adult corrections, in studies published before and after 1980, in randomized and nonrandomized designs, and in diversionary, community, and residential programs (albeit, attenuated in residential settings). Clinical sensitivity and a psychologically informed perspective on crime may assist in the renewed service, research, and conceptual efforts that are strongly indicated by our review.},

By contrast, today there is a vibrant movement to reaffirm rehabilitation and to implement programs based on the principles of effective intervention. How did this happen? I contend that the saving of rehabilitation was a contingent reality that emerged due to the efforts of a small group of loosely coupled research criminologists. These scholars rejected the “nothing works” professional ideology and instead used rigorous science to show that popular punitive interventions were ineffective, that offenders were not beyond redemption, and that treatment programs rooted in criminological knowledge were capable of meaningfully reducing recidivism. Their story is a reminder that, under certain conditions, the science of criminology is capable of making an important difference in the correctional enterprise, if not far beyond.},

	abstract = {Objective
To define confounding bias in difference‐in‐difference studies and compare regression‐ and matching‐based estimators designed to correct bias due to observed confounders.

Data sources
We simulated data from linear models that incorporated different confounding relationships: time‐invariant covariates with a time‐varying effect on the outcome, time‐varying covariates with a constant effect on the outcome, and time‐varying covariates with a time‐varying effect on the outcome. We considered a simple setting that is common in the applied literature: treatment is introduced at a single time point and there is no unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity.

Study design
We compared the bias and root mean squared error of treatment effect estimates from six model specifications, including simple linear regression models and matching techniques.

Data collection
Simulation code is provided for replication.

Principal findings
Confounders in difference‐in‐differences are covariates that change differently over time in the treated and comparison group or have a time‐varying effect on the outcome. When such a confounding variable is measured, appropriately adjusting for this confounder (ie, including the confounder in a regression model that is consistent with the causal model) can provide unbiased estimates with optimal SE. However, when a time‐varying confounder is affected by treatment, recovering an unbiased causal effect using difference‐in‐differences is difficult.

Conclusions
Confounding in difference‐in‐differences is more complicated than in cross‐sectional settings, from which techniques and intuition to address observed confounding cannot be imported wholesale. Instead, analysts should begin by postulating a causal model that relates covariates, both time‐varying and those with time‐varying effects on the outcome, to treatment. This causal model will then guide the specification of an appropriate analytical model (eg, using regression or matching) that can produce unbiased treatment effect estimates. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful incorporation of covariates to address confounding bias in difference‐in‐difference studies.},

It distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However, excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.},

	abstract = {Background: Interrupted time series analysis is increasingly used to evaluate the impact of large-scale health interventions. While segmented regression is a common approach, it is not always adequate, especially in the presence of seasonality and autocorrelation. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is an alternative method that can accommodate these issues.
Methods: We describe the underlying theory behind ARIMA models and how they can be used to evaluate population-level interventions, such as the introduction of health policies. We discuss how to select the shape of the impact, the model selection process, transfer functions, checking model fit, and interpretation of findings. We also provide R and SAS code to replicate our results.
Results: We illustrate ARIMA modelling using the example of a policy intervention to reduce inappropriate prescribing. In January 2014, the Australian government eliminated prescription refills for the 25 mg tablet strength of quetiapine, an antipsychotic, to deter its prescribing for non-approved indications. We examine the impact of this policy intervention on dispensing of quetiapine using dispensing claims data.
Conclusions: ARIMA modelling is a useful tool to evaluate the impact of large-scale interventions when other approaches are not suitable, as it can account for underlying trends, autocorrelation and seasonality and allows for flexible modelling of different types of impacts.},

Multiple statistical methods are available to analyse data from ITS studies, but no empirical investigation has examined how the different methods compare when applied to real-world datasets.
Methods:  A random sample of 200 ITS studies identified in a previous methods review were included. Time series data from each of these studies was sought. Each dataset was re-analysed using six statistical methods. Point and confidence interval estimates for level and slope changes, standard errors, p-values and estimates of autocorrelation were compared between methods.
Results:  From the 200 ITS studies, including 230 time series, 190 datasets were obtained. We found that the choice of statistical method can importantly affect the level and slope change point estimates, their standard errors, width of confidence intervals and p-values. Statistical significance (categorised at the 5\% level) often differed across the pairwise comparisons of methods, ranging from 4 to 25\% disagreement. Estimates of autocorrelation differed depending on the method used and the length of the series.
Conclusions:  The choice of statistical method in ITS studies can lead to substantially different conclusions about the impact of the interruption. Pre-specification of the statistical method is encouraged, and naive conclusions based on statistical significance should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Interrupted time‐series analysis (ITSA) is a popular study design when conducting a randomized experiment is not feasible. The design is called an interrupted time series because the intervention is expected to “interrupt” the level and/or trend of the outcome variable —measured at equal intervals over time—subsequent to its introduction. The ITSA design is most commonly used when there is a single aggregated treated unit (e.g., hospital, county, state) and the outcome of interest is reported at the summary level (e.g., morbidity or mortality rates). This article introduces the xtitsa command which generalizes the ITSA design for situations in which data are available at a more granular level (e.g., wards within hospital, zip codes within county, counties within state), allowing for the variability within the treatment group to be accounted for during estimation. The xtitsa command estimates the effect of an intervention on an outcome variable either for a single treatment group or when compared with a control group, and can estimate effects for multiple sequential interventions. Finally, as xtitsa is a wrapper for xtgee, there is tremendous flexibility in modelling outcomes with various distributions and autocorrelation structures.},

Collaborative programs between local public health and public safety agencies have emerged to connect overdose survivors and their personal networks with harm reduction and addiction treatment services following a non-fatal overdose event. This study explored the prevalence of these programs in Massachusetts and the different ways they have been structured and function.
Methods: We sent an online screening questionnaire to police and ﬁre departments in all 351 communities in Massachusetts to ﬁnd instances in which they collaborated with a community-based public health agency to implement a post-overdose outreach and support program. We conducted telephone interviews with communities that implemented this type of program and categorized programs based on their structure, outreach approach, and other key characteristics.
Results: Police and ﬁre personnel from 110 of the 351 communities in Massachusetts (31\% response rate) completed the screening survey. Among respondents, 21\% (23/110) had implemented a collaborative, community-based, post-overdose program with a well-deﬁned process to connect overdose survivors and their personal networks with support services or addiction treatment services. Using data from the interviews, we identiﬁed four types of programs: (1) Multi-Disciplinary Team Visit, (2) Police Visit with Referrals, (3) Clinician Outreach, and (4) Location-Based Outreach.
Conclusions: This study represents the ﬁrst attempt to systematically document an emerging approach intended to connect opioid overdose survivors and their personal networks with harm reduction and addiction treatment services soon after a non-fatal overdose event. These programs have the potential to increase engagement with the social service and addiction treatment systems by those who are at elevated risk for experiencing a fatal opioid overdose.},

              Methods
              We gathered victim-level data on fatal and nonfatal injurious police shootings from four states that have such information publicly available: Florida (2009–14), Colorado (2010–19), Texas (2015–19), and California (2016–19). For each state, we examined bivariate associations between mortality and race/ethnicity, gender, age, weapon, and access to trauma care. We also estimated logistic regression models predicting victim mortality in each state.
            
            
              Results
              Forty-five percent of these police shooting victims (N = 1,322) did not die. Black–white disparities were more pronounced in nonfatal injurious police shootings than in fatal police shootings. Overall, Black victims were less likely than white victims to die from their wound(s). Younger victims were less likely to die from their wound(s), as well as those who were unarmed.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Racial and age disparities in police shootings are likely more pronounced than previous estimates suggest.
            
            
              Policy implications
              Other states should strongly consider compiling data like that which is currently being gathered in California.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A serial cross-sectional study examined all unintentional opioid-related deaths in the US, evaluated annually from calendar years 2011 to 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The public health burden of opioid toxicity–related deaths was estimated in 2 ways. First, the proportion of all deaths that were attributable to unintentional opioid toxicity by year (2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021) and age group (15-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-74 years) were calculated, using age-specific estimates of all-cause mortality as the denominator. Second, the total years of life lost (YLL) due to unintentional opioid toxicity was estimated, overall and by sex and age group, for each year studied.
RESULTS Among the 422 605 unintentional deaths due to opioid toxicity between 2011 and 2021, the median age of the individuals was 39 (IQR, 30-51) years, and 69.7\% were male. The number of unintentional deaths due to opioid toxicity increased 289\% over the study period, from 19 395 (2011) to 75 477 (2021). Similarly, the percentage of all deaths that were attributed to opioid toxicity increased from 1.8\% in 2011 to 4.5\% in 2021. By 2021, opioid toxicity was responsible for 10.2\% of all deaths among those aged 15 to 19 years, 21.7\% of deaths among those aged 20 to 29 years, and 21.0\% of deaths among those aged 30 to 39 years. The YLL due to opioid toxicity increased 276\% over the study period, from 777 597 in 2011 to 2 922 497 in 2021. While YLL plateaued between 2017 (7.0 YLL per 1000) and 2019 (7.2 YLL per 1000), it increased by 62.9\% between 2019 and 2021 coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching 11.7 YLL per 1000 population. This relative increase was similar across all age groups and sexes with the exception of those aged 15 to 19 years, in whom the YLL nearly tripled, from 1.5 to 3.9 YLL per 1000 population.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, deaths due to opioid toxicity increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, 1 of every 22 deaths in the US was attributable to unintentional opioid toxicity, underscoring the urgent need to support people at risk of substance-related harm, particularly men, younger adults, and adolescents.},

Agnew's macro-level strain theory (MST), however, provides an additional explanation. MST contends that macro-level differences in crime and deviance can also be explained in terms of aggregate levels of anger and frustration. Following Agnew's recommendations, the authors conduct an initial school-level test of MST using data on aggressive student behavior from a national sample of public high schools. The results of the assessment lend partial support to the theory, showing that student-to-student conflict is partly a function of the level of anger in the student population. Other forms of aggressive student behavior, however, are not likewise affected. Nonetheless, the authors believe the findings are sufficiently promising to warrant further examination of MST, and they offer some suggestions in this regard.},

Drawing on this individual level theory, Agnew [Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 36 (1999) 123] recently suggested that GST might also be applicable to explaining variations in community crime rates. This macro level General Strain Theory (MST) has, however, rarely been empirically examined. This article provides an examination of some of the central ideas in Agnew’s MST using data from sixty-six neighborhoods in a southern state. The findings presented here suggest that neighborhood disadvantage and stability significantly affect neighborhood levels of strain. In turn, strain significantly affects levels of violence. The extent to which the effects of strain on violence are conditioned by levels of informal social control and social support/capital are also examined in this article. The results are partially supportive of MST.},

	abstract = {Objectives:
              Explanations of community violence traditionally reflect a social disorganization perspective, suggesting that neighborhood characteristics affect crime via the intervening mechanism of informal social control. Drawing on Agnew’s Macro Strain Theory [MST], we argue that neighborhood characteristics 1) also affect macro-level crime for reasons related to aggregated strain and 2) condition the relationship between micro-level strains and individual violent offending.
            
            
              Methods:
              Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, we conduct a series of multilevel models examining both the macro- and multi-level relationship between neighborhood characteristics, strain and youth violence.
            
            
              Findings:
              Results generally support our arguments, suggesting that neighborhood characteristics like concentrated disadvantage 1) remain associated with community violence even after adjusting for multiple measures of informal social control and 2) condition the association between micro-level strain and violent offending.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Strain processes, at both the macro and micro-level, play a critical role in the well-established empirical relationship between structural disadvantage and violence. In light of results, community crime control policies should address the ways in which structural disadvantage increases motivation, rather than focusing exclusively on the ways in which it weakens informal social control.},

	abstract = {Background: Applying the ‘‘risk environment’’ approach proposed by Rhodes (2002, 2009), this study considers the diverse contextual factors contributing to drug overdose in a deindustrialized region of the United States. The Monongahela Valley of Pennsylvania, once a global center of steel production, has suffered a mass exodus of jobs, residents, and businesses since a national manufacturing crisis erupted in the early 1980s; more recently, it has seen a dramatic uptick in accidental drug poisoning deaths. Where recent local and national media attention to overdose has focused on suburban areas and middle class victims, this study concentrates instead on the deteriorating mill city of McKeesport, Pennsylvania.
Methods: Eighteen clients of the city’s sole drug treatment facility participated in in-depth interviews concerning their direct experience with accidental overdose. Speciﬁcally, participants were asked to describe their own most recent overdose event and/or the last overdose they had personally witnessed. They were also asked to speculate upon the roots of the local overdose epidemic, while venturing possible remedies.
Results: In relating their overdose experiences, participants characterized a micro-level risk environment that was hidden behind closed doors, and populated by unprepared, ambivalent overdose ‘‘assistants.’’ Tasked with explaining a geographic concentration of overdose in and around McKeesport, interviewees referenced the hopelessness of the area and its lack of opportunity as driving the use of heroin, with many explicitly suggesting the need for jobs and community reinvestment to reduce fatalities.
Conclusion: While state and county efforts to ameliorate overdose mortality have focused upon creating an open market in naloxone, this study suggests the need for interventions that address the poverty and social isolation of opiate users in the post-industrial periphery.},

	abstract = {Background: Fentanyl test strip (FTS) programs are designed to promote fentanyl awareness and reduce overdose risk by providing people who use drugs (PWUD) with a method of testing drugs for the presence of fentanyl prior to use. In 2018, two large syringe services programs (SSP) in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic—one in Baltimore City, Maryland and one in the state of Delaware—began distributing FTS. We evaluated the implementation of these programs.
Methods: A convenience sample of SSP clients was surveyed in Baltimore City (urban) and Delaware (urban, suburban and rural) to assess FTS utilization patterns and drug use behaviors. Data were collected and analyzed in 2019.
Results: We surveyed N = 123 PWUD in Baltimore and N = 102 in Delaware. Collectively, 20,000 strips were distributed over six months. In both locations, high FTS utilization was reported (70\% in Baltimore; 77\% in Delaware) and clients reported testing a range of drugs including heroin, fentanyl and cocaine. Following utilization, 23\% and 69\% of respondents in Baltimore and Delaware adopted risk reduction behaviors (e.g., using less than intended, going slower, doing tester shot, asking someone to check on them). When asked about their level of interest in future FTS use, 49\% and 74\% reported being interested or very interested, respectively.
Conclusion: Our ﬁndings demonstrate that FTS programs could be helpful in promoting fentanyl awareness and risk reduction among PWUD and in monitoring the evolving drug supply in areas where comprehensive community-based drug checking programs have not been established.},

	abstract = {Background: In 2016, the number of overdose deaths involving illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (IMF) surpassed heroin and prescription opioid deaths in the United States for the first time, with IMF-involved overdose deaths increasing more than 500\% across 10 states from 2013 to 2016. IMF is an extremely potent synthetic opioid that is regularly mixed with heroin and often sold to unwitting consumers. Community-based organizations have started to distribute fentanyl test strips (FTS) as a strategy to identify IMF in street purchased products. We investigated the association between FTS use and changes in drug use behavior and perceived overdose safety among a community-based sample of people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States.
Methods: Between September-October 2017, a total of 125 PWID completed an online survey about their most recent FTS use in Greensboro, North Carolina. Our first outcome of interest included whether PWID engaged in any of the following changes in drug use behavior after using FTS: used less than usual, administered tester shot, pushed syringe plunger slower than usual, and snorted instead of injected. Our second outcome of interest was whether PWID felt that FTS use made them feel better able to protect themselves from overdose. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine the association between FTS use and these two outcomes.
Results: Overall, 63\% of the sample reported a positive FTS test result and 81\% reported using FTS prior to consuming their drugs. For the outcomes, 43\% reported a change in drug use behavior and 77\% indicated increased perceived overdose safety by using FTS. In multivariable models adjusting for demographic and FTS correlates, PWID with a positive FTS test result had five times the odds of reporting changes in drug use behavior compared to those with a negative result. PWID who used the FTS after drug consumption were 70\% less likely to report behavioral changes at subsequent drug consumption compared to those who used it before consumption. PWID who were not existing clients of the syringe services program had four times higher odds than existing clients to report increased overdose safety from using FTS.
Conclusions: We found that using FTS and receiving a positive test result was associated with changes in drug use behavior and perceptions of overdose safety. FTS may represent an effective addition to current overdose prevention efforts when included with other evidence-based strategies to prevent opioid overdose and related harm.},

But there is no existing theoretically based, empirically tested framework that can inform development and evaluation. This article presents a realist programme theory of such alternatives. It bases this on a realist review, which followed the Realist and Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES). It describes the systematic process of searching the literature in English on nine relevant countries (Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Jamaica, Netherland, Portugal, the UK, the USA) for information on alternative measures in three categories: depenalization; diversion; and decriminalization. It shows how these measures – in theory and in practice – combine with pre-existing social conditions and institutional contexts to trigger mechanisms across three causal pathways (normative; criminal justice; and health and social services). It shows how some posited causal processes are more empirically supported than others. Alternative measures can reduce harms imposed by criminal justice processes without increasing drug use or related health and crime harms, but this depends on specific combinations of contexts, mechanisms and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous reviews of the eﬀectiveness of measures to divert those who use drugs from the criminal justice system have focused mainly on post-conviction or post-sentence programs and report mixed results. The present systematic review synthesizes evidence on the eﬀectiveness of police-based diversion measures in reducing criminal oﬀenses and other harms related to drug use and then summarizes evidence from qualitative studies to identify facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation of such measures.
Methods: Eight databases were searched to ﬁnd evaluations of police-based diversion measures for drug-related oﬀenders. Twenty-seven studies were identiﬁed. The vote-count method and the Maryland Scientiﬁc Method Scale were used to assess the impact of police-based diversion measures. Themes related to barriers or conditions facilitating the implementation of these measures were extracted from qualitative studies.
Results: Evidence from quantitative studies indicates that in general police-based diversion measures are eﬀective in preventing criminal oﬀending and show promising results for improving participants’ health and diminishing social costs as well as costs associated with processing drug-related oﬀenses. There was insuﬃcient evidence to draw conclusions about the eﬀect of police-based diversion measures on drug use, drug accessibility, or changes in participants’ socioeconomic conditions. Findings from qualitative studies suggest that program acceptance by police oﬃcers, constructive intersectoral collaboration, clear eligibility criteria, and timely access to services seem to facilitate the implementation and delivery of police-based diversion measures.
Conclusion: Police-based diversion measures can be eﬀective in preventing drug-related criminal oﬀenses and harm. Additional research is needed to evaluate their eﬀect on participants’ socioeconomic conditions and drug use as well as drug accessibility.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Nonfatal opioid overdose is a significant risk factor for subsequent fatal overdose. The time after a nonfatal overdose may provide a critical engagement opportunity to both reduce subsequent overdose risk and link individuals to treatment. Post-overdose interventions have emerged in affected communities throughout the United States (US). The objective of this scoping review is to identify US-based post-overdose intervention models (1) described in peer-reviewed literature and (2) implemented in public health and community settings.
Methods: Using the adapted PRISMA Checklist for Scoping Reviews, we searched PubMed, PsychInfo, Academic OneFile, and federal and state databases for peer-reviewed and gray literature descriptions of post-overdose programs. We developed search strings with a reference librarian. We included studies or programs with at least the following information available: name of program, description of key components, intervention team, and intervention timing.
Results: We identified a total of 27 programs, 3 from the peer-reviewed literature and 24 from the gray literature. 9 programs operated out of the ED, while 18 programs provided post-overdose support in other ways: through home or overdose location visits, mobile means, or as law enforcement diversion. Commonly, they include partnerships among public safety and community service providers.
Conclusions: Programs are emerging throughout the US to care for individuals after a nonfatal opioid overdose. There is variability in the timing, components, and follow-up in these programs and little is known about their effectiveness. Future work should focus on evaluation and testing of post-overdose programs so that best practices for care can be implemented.},

	abstract = {Background: Post-overdose outreach programs engage survivors in harm reduction and treatment to prevent future overdoses. In Massachusetts, these emerging programs commonly deploy teams comprised of police and public health professionals based on 911 call information. Some teams use name/address data to conduct arrest warrant checks prior to outreach visits. We used mixed methods to understand approaches to outreach related to warrant checking, from the perspectives of police and public health outreach agencies and staﬀ.
Methods: We analyzed a 2019 statewide survey of post-overdose outreach programs in Massachusetts to classify approaches to warrant checking and identify program and community factors associated with particular approaches. Ethnographic analysis of qualitative interviews conducted with outreach staﬀ helped further contextualize outreach program practices related to warrants.
Results: A majority (57\% - 79/138) of post-overdose outreach programs in Massachusetts conducted warrant checks prior to outreach. Among programs that checked warrants, we formulated a taxonomy of approaches to handling warrants: 1) performing outreach without addressing warrants (19.6\% - 27/138), 2) delaying outreach until warrants are cleared (15.9\% - 22/138), 3) arresting the survivor (11/138 – 8.0\%), 4) taking a situational approach (10/138 – 7.2\%), 5) not performing outreach (9/138 – 6.5\%). Program characteristics and staﬀ training did not vary across approaches. From police and public health outreach staﬀ interviews (n = 38), we elicited four major themes: a) diverse motivations precede warrant checking, b) police oﬃcers feel tension between dual roles, c) warrants alter approaches to outreach, and d) teams leverage warrants in relationships. Findings from both analyses converged to demonstrate unintended consequences of warrant checking.
Conclusion: Checking warrants prior to post-overdose outreach visits can result in arrest, delayed outreach, and barriers to obtaining services for overdose survivors, which can undermine the goal of these programs to engage overdose survivors. With the public health imperative of engaging overdose survivors, programs should consider limiting warrant checking and police participation in ﬁeld activities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the implementation of postoverdose outreach programs among Massachusetts municipalities was associated with lower opioid fatality rates compared with municipalities without postoverdose outreach programs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective interrupted time-series analysis was performed over 26 quarters (from January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2019) across 93 municipalities in Massachusetts. These 93 municipalities were selected based on a threshold of 30 or more opioid-related emergency medical services (EMS) responses in 2015. Data were analyzed from November 2021 to August 2022. EXPOSURES The main exposure was municipality postoverdose outreach programs. Municipalities had various program inceptions during the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was quarterly municipal opioid fatality rate per 100 000 population. The secondary outcome was quarterly municipal opioid-related EMS response (ambulance trips) rates per 100 000 population.
RESULTS The mean (SD) population size across 93 municipalities was 47 622 (70 307), the mean (SD) proportion of female individuals was 51.5\% (1.5\%) and male individuals was 48.5\% (1.5\%), and the mean (SD) age proportions were 29.7\% (4.0\%) younger than 25 years, 26.0\% (4.8\%) aged 25 to 44 years, 14.8\% (2.1\%) aged 45 to 54 years, 13.4\% (2.1\%) aged 55 to 64 years, and 16.1\% (4.4\%) aged 65 years or older. Postoverdose programs were implemented in 58 municipalities (62\%). Following implementation, there were no significant level changes in opioid fatality rate (adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.19; P = .20). However, there was a significant slope decrease in opioid fatality rate (annualized aRR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.90-0.98; P = .003) compared with the municipalities without the outreach programs. Similarly, there was a significant slope decrease in opioid-related EMS response rates (annualized aRR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.89-0.98; P = .007). Several sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, among Massachusetts municipalities with high numbers of opioid-related EMS responses, implementation of postoverdose outreach programs was significantly associated with lower opioid fatality rates over time compared with municipalities that did not implement such programs. Program components, including cross-sectoral partnerships, operational best practices, involvement of law enforcement, and related program costs, warrant further evaluation to enhance effectiveness.},

            Overreliance on opioid medications is emblematic of a health care system that incentivizes quick, simplistic answers to complex physical and mental health needs. In an analogous way, simplistic measures to cut access to opioids offer illusory solutions to this multidimensional societal challenge.
            We trace the crisis’ trajectory through the intertwined use of opioid analgesics, heroin, and fentanyl analogs, and we urge engaging the structural determinants lens to address this formidable public health emergency. A broad focus on suffering should guide both patient- and community-level interventions.},

	abstract = {Police scholars have studied the creation and formalization of police organizations in U.S. cities during the mid-1800s, and competing explanations describe why cities adopted formal and professional police departments. Riots, class conflict, and an increase in crime have been proposed as reasons why cities created police agencies. The current study tests whether police organizations were created and formalized in response to city-level differences in dangerous classes, specifically African Americans. Using intercensal estimates of historical Census data from 1840 to 1930, this study analyzes the importance of racial ratios as they relate to the creation of a formalized police department in 64 U.S. cities. The data is sourced primarily from northern cities, as these were among the first areas to formally adopt police departments. Definitively determining a cause or causes of police agency creation is both an interesting and unique research question that has not been addressed. Empirically testing historical police theories is rare because the data is notoriously hard to acquire. This study attempts to remedy this situation by pulling data from four sources of agency creation. Results indicate that the racial composition of a city was not a significant predictor of the creation of a police department. Importantly, this finding indicates that other explanations of police agency creation should be tested empirically.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Midlife increases in suicides and drug poisonings have been previously noted. However, that these upward trends were persistent and large enough to drive up all-cause midlife mortality has, to our knowledge, been overlooked. If the white mortality rate for ages 45−54 had held at their 1998 value, 96,000 deaths would have been avoided from 1999–2013, 7,000 in 2013 alone. If it had continued to decline at its previous (1979‒1998) rate, half a million deaths would have been avoided in the period 1999‒2013, comparable to lives lost in the US AIDS epidemic through mid-2015. Concurrent declines in self-reported health, mental health, and ability to work, increased reports of pain, and deteriorating measures of liver function all point to increasing midlife distress.
          , 
            This paper documents a marked increase in the all-cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States between 1999 and 2013. This change reversed decades of progress in mortality and was unique to the United States; no other rich country saw a similar turnaround. The midlife mortality reversal was confined to white non-Hispanics; black non-Hispanics and Hispanics at midlife, and those aged 65 and above in every racial and ethnic group, continued to see mortality rates fall. This increase for whites was largely accounted for by increasing death rates from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Although all education groups saw increases in mortality from suicide and poisonings, and an overall increase in external cause mortality, those with less education saw the most marked increases. Rising midlife mortality rates of white non-Hispanics were paralleled by increases in midlife morbidity. Self-reported declines in health, mental health, and ability to conduct activities of daily living, and increases in chronic pain and inability to work, as well as clinically measured deteriorations in liver function, all point to growing distress in this population. We comment on potential economic causes and consequences of this deterioration.},

Neighborhood racial composition significantly shapes drug law enforcement practices, net of neighborhood-level violent and property crime rates, drug-related calls for service by citizens, and socioeconomic disadvantage.

We conduct negative binomial regression analyses using arrest data from a mid-sized city in the South between 2010 and 2015.

              Methods:
              Longitudinal data from Glendale, Arizona, a city at the epicenter of the nation’s foreclosure problem. The authors rely on four data sources: (1) foreclosure data, (2) computer-aided dispatch (CAD)/police records management system (RMS) data, (3) U.S. census and census estimate data, and (4) land use data.
            
            
              Results:
              Foreclosure has a short-term impact, typically no more than 3 months, on total crime, property crime, and violent crime, and no more than 4 months for drug crime.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Foreclosures do not have a long-term effect on crime in general, and have different, though modest effects on different types of crime. The relationship between foreclosure and crime is not linear in nature but rather is characterized by a temporal, short-term flux in crime.},

I construct 10 alternative measures of social interaction and separately examine the effect of each on the rates of three serious crimes across 60 urban neighborhoods. Findings suggest that type of interaction matters.

	abstract = {In 2017, San Francisco (SF) implemented Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD), a program Beckett described as harm reduction policing. Through a process and outcome evaluation of LEAD SF, this paper demonstrates the positive impacts of harm reduction policing, on those who use drugs and/or engage in sex work. When law enforcement officers used their discretion to divert individuals into LEAD rather than arrest, those individuals had significantly fewer felony and misdemeanor arrests and felony cases, in comparison to a propensity score matched group. The focus group and interview data describe that the collaboration, the warm handoff, and LEAD’s harm reduction principles were mechanisms of success. However, obtaining officer buy-in was a key challenge. Despite that obstacle, LEAD SF’s harm reduction policing reduces offending, improves the wellbeing of people who use drugs and engage in sex work, and allows the police to carry out their mandate to protect and serve.},

	title = {When {Should} {You} {Adjust} {Standard} {Errors} for {Clustering}?},
	abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To identify whether opening the first 2 government-sanctioned OPCs in the US was associated with changes in crime and disorder. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cohort study, difference-in-differences Poisson regression models were used to compare crime, residents’ requests for assistance for emergencies and nuisance complaints, and police enforcement in the vicinity of NYC’s 2 OPCs with those around 17 other syringe service programs that did not offer overdose prevention services from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in the volume of crimes reported by the public or observed by police; arrests for drug possession and weapons; 911 calls and 311 calls regarding crime, public nuisances, and medical events; and summonses issued by police for criminal infractions in both the immediate vicinity of the sites (ie, a hexagonal area spanning about 6 city blocks) and their wider neighborhoods (ie, a tesselated 3-hexagon array spanning about 18 city blocks).
RESULTS No significant changes were detected in violent crimes or property crimes recorded by police, 911 calls for crime or medical incidents, or 311 calls regarding drug use or unsanitary conditions observed in the vicinity of the OPCs. There was a significant decline in low-level drug enforcement, as reflected by a reduction in arrests for drug possession near the OPCs of 82.7\% (95\% CI, −89.9\% to −70.4\%) and a reduction in their broader neighborhoods of 74.5\% (95\% CI, −87.0\% to −50.0\%). Significant declines in criminal court summonses issued in the immediate vicinity by 87.9\% (95\% CI, −91.9\% to −81.9\%) and in the neighborhoods around the OPCs by 59.7\% (95\% CI, −73.8\% to −38.0\%) were observed. Reductions in enforcement were consistent with the city government’s support for the 2 OPCs, which may have resulted in a desire not to deter clients from using the sites by fear of arrest for drug possession.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this difference-in-differences cohort study, the first 2 government-sanctioned OPCs in the US were not associated with significant changes in measures of crime or disorder. These observations suggest the expansion of OPCs can be managed without negative crime or disorder outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background:  Policing shapes the health risks of people who use drugs (PWUD), but little is understood about interventions that can align officer practices with PWUD health. This study deploys the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to understand what influences police intentions to make discretionary referrals to treatment and harm reduction resources rather than arrest on less serious charges.
Methods:  On-line surveys integrating TPB constructs and adapting an instrument measuring police intentions to make mental health treatment referrals were completed by police employees in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Missouri. They also included items about stigma towards PWUD and attitudes and beliefs about opioid addiction, treatment, and recovery. Findings:  Across the sites, 259 respondents perceived control over their decision to arrest for misdemeanors (69\%) and confiscate items such as syringes (56\%). Beliefs about others’ approval of referrals to treatment, its ability to reduce future arrests, and to increase trust in police were associated with stated practices of nonarrest for drug and possession and making referrals (p ≤ .001), and nonarrest for syringe possession (p ≤ .05). Stigma a towards PWUD was negatively associated with stated practices of nonarrest (p ≤ .05). Respondents identified supervisors as having the most influence over use of discretion, seriousness of the offense as the most influential value, and attitude of the suspect as the most important situational factor. The 17 Likert scale items analyzed had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.81.
Conclusion:  The TPB offers untapped potential to better understand and modify police practices. In designing interventions to improve the health outcomes of police encounters with PWUD, further research should validate instruments that measure the relationship between these variables and discretionary intentions, and that measure role-relevant police stigma towards PWUD.},

Then, the daily time-series data for arrest rate, use of force rate, and traffic stop rate were created (N = 918; 459 days pre-COVID-19 and 459 days during COVID-19). The results showed that COVID-19 statistically significantly decreased traffic stops and arrests, but not use of force on the day immediately following the implementation of the COVID-19 restrictions and then remained stable over time. However, no significant change was detected in the trends of arrests, traffic stops, and use of force before and during the COVID-19 period. COVID-19 had a significant immediate and lasting effect on traffic stops and arrests, but not use of force.},

Utilizing two Midwest cities (Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska) as comparison cities, we assess whether violent firearm incidents increased in Minneapolis after the murder of George Floyd. Multiple interrupted time-series analyses showed statistically significant increases in weekly firearm incidents in Minneapolis (AME = 10.63, p {\textless} 0.05) and Omaha (AME = 1.47, p {\textless} 0.5) following the murder of George Floyd. No significant results were found in Kansas City. Similar relationships were found when examining monthly firearm incidents. The firearm spike in Minneapolis thus represents an approximate 10-fold increase in weekly firearm incidents relative to that observed in Omaha. We conclude, therefore, that the murder of George Floyd was associated with a substantially greater increase in firearm violence in Minneapolis than in the two comparison cities. Police training to reduce police violence and public health approaches to reduce urban firearm violence will alleviate the social and economic impacts of violence on federal and state governments.},

The study investigates whether and to what extent officers armed with the TASER use it as an alternative to other types of less-lethal force (e.g., empty hands, pepper spray, and the baton) and the firearm, controlling for the level of suspect resistance. The findings indicate that officers who were armed with the TASER were significantly less likely to deploy pepper spray and the baton in response to aggressive physical resistance. Additionally, the results show that officers equipped with the TASER were less likely to discharge their firearm when confronted with suspect resistance that was potentially lethal. No differences in police behavior occurred in response to passive suspect resistance.},

However, concerns that people who use drugs will engage in riskier drug behaviors if they have access to naloxone remain prevalent, and the measurement scales to assess these risk compensation concerns remain under researched. This study aims to examine the validity of the Naloxone-Related Risk Compensation Beliefs (NaRRC-B) scale and to understand the effect of overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training on risk compensation beliefs across demographic and professional populations. Methods: A total of 1424 participants, 803 police officers, 137 emergency medical services (EMS)/fire personnel, and 484 clinical treatment and social service providers were administered surveys before and after attending an OEND training. Survey items measured the endorsement of opioid overdose knowledge and attitudes, as well as risk compensation beliefs. Results: Police and EMS/fire personnel expressed greater endorsement of risk compensation beliefs than clinical treatment and social service providers at both pre- and post-OEND training. Although endorsement of risk compensation beliefs was significantly reduced in each of the 3 groups after the training, reductions were greatest among EMS/fire personnel, followed by providers, then police. Moreover, younger, male, and black participants endorsed greater beliefs in risk compensatory behaviors as compared with their older, female, and white counterparts. Conclusion: This study validated a novel measure of naloxone-related risk compensation beliefs and suggests participating in OEND trainings decreases beliefs in naloxone-related risk compensation behaviors. OEND trainings should consider addressing concerns about naloxone “enabling” drug use, particularly in law enforcement settings, to continue to reduce stigma surrounding naloxone availability.},

Baseline data (94 officers) confirmed anxiety about needlestick injuries, poor legal knowledge, and occupational risk overestimation. Before training, respondents believed that syringe access promotes drug use (51\%), increases likelihood of police needlestick injuries (58\%), and fails to reduce epidemics (38\%). Pretraining to posttraining evaluation suggested significant shifts in legal and occupational safety knowledge; changes in attitudes toward syringe access were promising. Training that combines occupational safety with syringe access content can help align law enforcement with public health goals.

The present study had 2 goals: (a) to assess the psychometric properties of a CF scale, and (b) to examine the scale's predictive validity in a multivariate model. The data came from a survey of social workers living in New York City following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Factor analyses indicated that the CF scale measured multiple dimensions. After overlapping items were eliminated, the scale measured 2 key underlying dimensions--secondary trauma and job burnout. In a multivariate model, these dimensions were related to psychological distress, even after other risk factors were controlled. The authors discuss the results in light of increasing the ability of professional caregivers to meet the emotional needs of their clients within a stressful environment without experiencing CF.

There is continued advocacy for collaborations between public health partners to create joint responses. The high correlation between persons with opioid use disorder who have a history of involvement in the criminal justice system is widely recognized, and allows for treatment intervention opportunities. Law enforcement-led treatment initiatives are still relatively new, with a few sparse early programs emerging almost a decade ago and only gaining popularity in the past few years. A lack of published methodologies creates a gap in the knowledge of applied programs that are effective and can be duplicated. This article seeks to outline an interagency relationship between police and healthcare that illustrates arrest is not the only option that law enforcement may utilize when encountering persons who use illicit substances. Program methods of a joint initiative between law enforcement and healthcare in a large, metropolitan area will be reviewed, supplemented with law enforcement overdose data and statistics on law enforcement treatment referrals.},

We find that in almost all cases, aggregating crime types is inappropriate for polygon-based analyses. Only in the cases of micro-spatial units of analysis (street segments) may these aggregations be appropriate. Therefore, aggregating crime types in a study that implicitly or explicitly considers the spatial patterns of crime is inappropriate.},

Meanwhile, in response to the longstanding harms produced by drug law enforcement, calls for harm reduction policing have gained traction in recent years, resulting in collaborations between policing agencies and health services, including naloxone administration by police officers, post-overdose outreach and wellness checks, and integrated public health-public safety response and information sharing frameworks. Using situational analysis method, we consider the range of elements and actors that form these partnerships, and their broader structural, institutional, and policy effects. We detail the actual and potential implications of such forms of institutional coordination on health, equity, and the possibility of meaningful drug law reform. Our analysis reveals that rather than mitigating the harms of drug enforcement, such initiatives stand to undermine access to services and increase health system avoidance by eroding trust in public health and harm reduction among PWUD. We reason that the recasting of police as therapeutic agents and as embedded in medico-therapeutic practices reaffirms the role of punitive enforcement practices in drug governance.},

Yet, little is known about how police officers view drug addiction – as a disease, a moral failure, or something else – and how their frameworks for conceptualizing addiction impact their attitudes toward drug policies, including the use of naloxone. This research examined police officers’ adherence to a moralistic addiction framework in relation to their support for treatment-oriented drug policies. Officers (N = 618) were surveyed about their beliefs on drug policy and the extent to which drug addiction was a product of one’s morals or related to social or biological reasons. Results found that approximately 22\% of the variance in drug policy attitudes could be explained by addiction frameworks and control variables. Officers who embraced a biological perspective of addiction were more supportive of policies that expanded treatment, including access to naloxone, and less punitive sanctions. Those with stronger moralistic views were less supportive of expanding treatment initiatives and endorsed expanding punitive sanctions. Officer age and education was positively related with expanding treatment and naloxone use while exposure to overdoses was negatively related to policy support. These results demonstrate that officers’ frameworks about drug addiction play an important role in drug policy attitudes and, by extension, how they might interact with people who use drugs.},

	abstract = {Background
Post-overdose outreach has emerged in the United States as an increasingly common response to non-fatal overdose. This qualitative study investigates the implementation of such programs through public health-public safety partnerships in Massachusetts.
Methods
We conducted semi-structured interviews with post-overdose outreach team members, overdose survivors, and family members who received outreach. Interview transcripts were inductively analyzed to identify emergent themes and subsequently organized within the framework of Ecological Systems Theory.
Results
Forty-nine interviews were conducted, including 15 police officers (80\% male, 100\% non-Hispanic White); 23 public health partners (48\% male, 87\% non-Hispanic White); 8 overdose survivors who received outreach services and 3 parents of survivors who received services (collectively 27\% male, 64\% non-Hispanic White). Implementation factors identified across all levels (macrosystem, exosystem, mesosystem, and microsystem) of Ecological Systems Theory included key program facilitators, such as access to police data and funding (macro), interagency collaboration (exo), shared recognition of community needs (exo), supportive relationships among team members (meso), and program champions (micro). Common barriers included inherent contradictions between policing and public health mandates (macro), poor local treatment and service capacity (exo), divergent staff views of program goals (exo), overdose survivors’ prior negative experiences with law enforcement (meso), difficulty locating overdose survivors (meso), and police officers’ lack of qualifications or training in providing psycho-social services (micro).
Conclusions
Most post-overdose outreach programs in this study were dependent on funding and data-sharing partnerships, which police agencies largely controlled. Yet, police participation, especially during outreach visits presented numerous challenges for engaging overdose survivors and establishing non-coercive linkages with evidence-based services, which may undermine the public health goals of these programs. These findings should inform state and federal efforts to expand the role of law enforcement in behavioral health initiatives.},

	abstract = {Non-fatal and fatal overdoses are traumatic events that have been increasing over the past 20 years and dis­ proportionately impacting rural communities in the United States. The human suffering caused by the opioid epidemic is rarely described in the empirical literature. The purpose of this article is to 1) define individual- and community-level overdose-related compassion fatigue (OCF), 2) review measurement of compassion fatigue (CF) and interventions to reduce CF, 3) discuss strategies that may reduce OCF and 4) briefly discuss policy im­ plications. OCF is distress resulting from knowledge of or exposure to overdose-related harms, which at the community-level may prohibit collaboration and adaptive agency to effectively respond. When OCF occurs at a community-level, it could have negative consequences by eroding support for evidence-based services and fueling stigma-driven policies that blame people who use drugs. Empathy underlies both OCF and vicarious resilience by allowing one to understand the suffering caused by overdose deaths and to witness the joy of addiction recovery. Using the risk environment framework, OCF at the micro- and macro-levels of the social environment, may increase rural communities’ vulnerability to harm by emphasizing individual responsibility for reducing overdoses rather than community-level infrastructure and resource management. Additional re­ search is needed to develop a measure of OCF and to confirm whether OCF is associated with increased stigma and decreased support for harm reduction in rural areas.},

As a technological solution to the perception that officers use force too often, BWCs have not fared well. This dissertation sidesteps questions of effectiveness, however, and instead investigates how the cameras are perceived by officers, and how variations in BWC policies affect perceptions of monitoring fairness. To do so, I use a national probability sample of officers (n = 529) drawn from a stratified sample of agencies across the United States.Theoretically, I draw primarily from two literatures. First, from the organizational psychology literature, which is where the vast majority of research on the individual-level effects of electronic workplace surveillance has been done. Second, I draw on the organizationaljustice literature, specifically elements related to how criminal justice employees form judgements of fairness regarding their workplace treatment. The results show how policy variation in BWC activation and footage review affect officer perceptions of fairnessboth on their own and interactively.},

In this paper, we examine the characteristics, labor market attachment, geographic mobility, earnings, and safety net utilization of this population in order to understand their economic well-being. This paper is the first to examine these outcomes at the national level using administrative data on income and government program receipt. It is part of the Comprehensive Income Dataset project, which combines household survey data with administrative records to improve estimates of income and related statistics. Specifically, we use restricted microdata from the 2010 Decennial Census, which enumerates both sheltered and unsheltered homeless people, the 2006-2016 American Community Survey (ACS), which surveys sheltered homeless people, and longitudinal shelter-use data from several major U.S. cities. We link these data to longitudinal administrative tax records as well as administrative data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), veterans’ benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, housing assistance, and mortality. Our approach benefits from large samples that offer a guide to national homelessness patterns and allow us to compare estimates between data sources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s point-in-time (PIT) counts. By shedding light on issues of data linkage and survey coverage among homeless people, this paper contributes to efforts to better incorporate this hard-to-survey population into income and poverty estimates.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess how the caseload and the utilisation of community-based mental health services is influenced by distance and to socioeconomic characteristics.
Spatial and statistical analyses were conducted with a sample of 12,347 patients, with ICD-10 psychiatric diagnosis, who had at least one contact with psychiatric services in Verona, Italy, between 2000 and 2006. Three types of mental health facility were considered: acute inpatient wards, outpatient clinics, and community mental health centres (CMHC). To measure distance and accessibility, the locations of static mental health facilities and patients' homes were geocoded. Data were organised in a spatial database, which included census blocks, catchment areas locations, road network graphs, patients' and facilities' locations. In order to calculate travel distances, patients' and facilities' locations were connected to the road network. Accessibility was modelled by using the Network Analyst Service Area Function and 13 Service Areas were created around all facility locations, by measuring distances along the street network. For the epidemiological analyses, patients and census block centroids were linked to the service areas by using spatial join techniques. Epidemiological and utilisation analyses were performed for each type of setting.
The facilities were not equally located in the catchment areas. Of particular significance, rural areas appear to be poorly served by mental health services. The distance decay effect exists, with different trends for the three types of facility. The caseload (number of patients using services) decreased with increasing distance; at a distance of 10 km, there was a decrease of 80, 60 and 85\%, respectively, for CMHCs, inpatients wards and outpatients clinics. From the Poisson regression models, distance was significantly correlated (p value {\textless} 0.0001) with service use. Also univariate analyses showed a statistically significant association between distance and caseload for each type of setting (p value {\textless} 0.05), with a decrease in service use for each service area increase in distance (1.5\% for acute inpatient wards, 2.0\% for CMHC, and 2.1\% outpatient clinics). By adding other predictors in the Poisson regression models, these percentages increased.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the influence of other factors, such as environmental variables, that may influence the use of mental health services.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {A description is given of a methodology for estimating transit walk accessibility at the home end of transit trips and for forecasting transit walk accessibility at the home end for a future year, given forecast population and employment data, transit route information, and type of street configuration. The methodology for estimating transit walk accessibility overcomes the problems associated with natural and man-made barriers such as water bodies and community walls and the problem of uneven distribution of population. A comparison of the results with those from the traditional buffer method, as well as with network ratio methods that consider actual walk distance along streets, showed that both the buffer method and network ratio methods tended to overestimate transit walk accessibility. Regression analysis also showed that the new transit walk accessibility measure was a stronger predictor of transit use than that produced using the buffer method. The methodologies may be applied to transit planning, urban design for sustainable development, and long-range transit demand modeling.},

This study uses the CT case files of a county criminal district attorney’s office to investigate how cases involving defendants experiencing homelessness are handled compared with other defendants. Results show that homeless defendants make up a substantial portion of all CT cases, are more likely to be repeat CT defendants, and account for most jail sentences. Whereas defendants with mental health issues were often deferred for services, this avenue was not similarly extended to homeless defendants. Qualitative analyses show varied circumstances related to CT arrest for homeless and non-homeless defendants. The findings suggest various policy implications to refocus police resources and promote interagency cooperation to address the underlying causes of CT involvement by people experiencing homelessness.},

In 2013, Chico, California, followed suit by passing several ordinances, most notably, a “sit‐lie” ordinance that prohibits individuals from sitting or lying in commercial districts and other public spaces. Broadly, this article explores the implications of this punitive approach to homelessness. Specifically, relying primarily upon arrest data extending over six and a half years, we explore how enforcement of the sit‐lie ordinance affected arrest rates of homeless individuals, as well as the geographic location of those arrests. Our expectations are supported—arrests of homeless individuals increased significantly in the “post sit‐lie” period, and the location of arrests clearly shifted away from the downtown area. Finally, given economic motivations of the ordinances, we estimate the costs to city law enforcement of policing the homeless population and find that costs are nearly twice as large as police department estimates.

              不论是大城市还是小城市，都越来越多地采取公共安全政策处理有关无家可归的问题。 2013年，加利福尼亚州的奇科市就此问题也跟着出台了一些法令，其中最引人注目的是 “禁止坐躺” （Sit‐lie）法令，该法令禁止人们在商业区和其他公共场所随地就坐或躺下。概括而言，本文将探讨这种惩罚性措施对无家可归者可能造成的影响。具体而言，本文将主要对超过六年半的逮捕数据进行分析，以探讨 “禁止坐躺” 法令的执行是如何影响无家可归者的被逮捕率及其被逮捕的地理位置。我们的预期也得到了证实 ——在 “禁止坐躺” 法令出台期间，对违反这一法令的无家可归者的逮捕大幅上升，并且逮捕地点明显远离了市区。最后，考虑到该法令的经济动机，笔者预估了城市执法机关对无家可归者进行治安管制的成本，并发现该成本几乎是警察部门预估的两倍。

            Resumen
            
              
              Las ciudades, tanto grandes como pequeñas, están utilizando más y más políticas de seguridad pública para abordar temas locales que tienen que ver con el desamparo. En 2013, Chico, CA siguió este ejemplo al aprobar varias reglas, más notablemente, la regla de “sentar‐acostar” que prohíbe a los individuos sentarse o acostarse en distritos comerciales y otros espacios públicos. En general, este documento explora las implicaciones de esta aproximación punitiva para el desamparo. Específicamente, el apoyarse primordialmente en datos de arrestos que se extienden a más de seis años y medio, exploramos cómo la acción policíaca de la regla “sentarse‐acostarse” tuvo un impacto en la proporción de arrestos de individuos sin hogar, así como también la ubicación geográfica de esos arrestos. Nuestras expectativas están sustentadas – los arrestos de los individuos sin hogar incrementaron significativamente en el periodo después de la regla “acostarse‐sentarse” y la ubicación de los arrestos claramente se mudó fuera del área central de la ciudad. Finalmente, dadas las motivaciones económicas de las reglas, estimamos que los costos para la ciudad de la acción policíaca en contra de la población desamparada, y encontramos que los costos son el doble de lo que estima el departamento de policía.},

Objectives: In light of growing attention to police brutality in the United States, this paper explores interconnections between speciﬁc War on Drugs policing strategies and police-related violence against Black adolescents and adults in the United States. Methods: This paper reviews literature about (1) historical connections between race/ethnicity and policing in the United States; (2) the ways that the War on Drugs eroded speciﬁc legal protections originally designed to curtail police powers; and (3) the implications of these erosions for police brutality targeting Black communities. Results: Policing and racism have been mutually constitutive in the United States. Erosions to the 4th Amendment to the Constitution and to the Posse Comitatus Act set the foundations for two War on Drugs policing strategies: stop and frisk and Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams. These strategies have created speciﬁc conditions conducive to police brutality targeting Black communities. Conclusions/Importance: War on Drugs policing strategies appear to increase police brutality targeting Black communities, even as they make little progress in reducing street-level drug activity. Several jurisdictions are retreating from the War on Drugs; this retreat should include restoring rights originally protected by the 4th Amendment and Posse Comitatus. While these legal changes occur, police chiefs should discontinue the use of SWAT teams to deal with low-level nonviolent drug offenses and should direct ofﬁcers to cease engaging in stop and frisk.},

	abstract = {Background  Although naloxone is widely acknowledged as a life-saving intervention and a critical tool for first responders, there remains a need to explore how law enforcement officers have adapted to a shifting scope of work. Past research has focused mainly on officer training, their abilities to administer naloxone, and to a lesser extent on their experiences and interactions working with people who use drugs (PWUD).
Methods  A qualitative approach was used to explore officer perspectives and behaviors surrounding responses to incidents of suspected opioid overdose. Between the months of March and September 2017, semi-structured inter‑views were conducted with 38 officers from 17 counties across New York state (NYS).
Results  Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that officers generally considered the additional responsibility of administering naloxone to have become “part of the job”. Many officers reported feeling as though they are expected to wear multiple hats, functioning as both law enforcement and medical personnel and at times juggling contradic‑tory roles. Evolving views on drugs and drug use defined many interviews, as well as the recognition that a punitive approach to working with PWUD is not the solution, emphasizing the need for cohesive, community-wide support strategies. Notable differences in attitudes toward PWUD appeared to be influenced by an officer’s connection to someone who uses drugs and/or due to a background in emergency medical services.
Conclusion  Law enforcement officers in NYS are emerging as an integral part of the continuum of care for PWUD. Our findings are capturing a time of transition as more traditional approaches to law enforcement appear to be shifting toward those prioritizing prevention and diversion. Widespread adoption of naloxone administration by law enforcement officers in NYS is a powerful example of the successful integration of a public health intervention into police work.},

	abstract = {Background: The opioid epidemic in the United States continues to surge, reaching record deaths from opioid and fentanyl overdoses in 2020. This study analyzes spatial and neighborhood correlates of free naloxone distribution sites as well as overdose and naloxone reversal events in Baltimore, Maryland, which has one of the highest overdose rates in the country.
Methods: Using data from a randomized clinical trial on HIV prevention among people using substances in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as demographic data from the US Census Bureau, we conducted: (1) exploratory spatial visualizations of census tracts’ minimum distance to naloxone distribution sites, (2) univariable Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare census tracts on demographic metrics, and (3) bivariable and multivariable negative binomial regression models to assess associations between census tract characteristics and naloxone reversal events.
Results: Valid geographic data were provided for 518 overdose events involving either fentanyl or heroin in this study. Of these, 190 (37\%) attempted naloxone reversal events were reported. Exploratory spatial visualization techniques suggest that most distribution sites are appropriately located near populations at high risk of overdose, but study ﬁndings also identify areas where drug use and overdoses occur that are located farther from distribution sites. In multivariable analyses, naloxone administration was signiﬁcantly and inversely associated with distance to the nearest distribution site (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.72 per 1000m increase, 95\% CI 0.59-0.89, p=0.002).
Conclusion: Study ﬁndings emphasize the correlation between proximity to naloxone sites and utilization of resources, highlighting that physical proximity to harm reduction resources may contribute to uptake. Results further underscore that research on service accessibility and utilization must consider the spatial distribution of health services.},

	abstract = {The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid abuse. In response, many states have increased access to naloxone, a drug that can save lives when administered during an overdose. However, naloxone access may unintentionally increase opioid abuse through two channels: (1) reducing the risk of death per use, thereby making riskier opioid use more appealing, and (2) saving the lives of active drug users, who survive to continue abusing opioids. By increasing the number of opioid abusers who need to fund their drug purchases, naloxone access laws may also increase theft. We exploit the staggered timing of naloxone access laws to estimate the total effects of these laws.We find that broadening naloxone access led to more opioid-related emergency room visits and more opioid-related theft, with no reduction in opioid-related mortality. These effects are driven by urban areas and vary by region. We find the most detrimental effects in the Midwest, including a 14\% increase in opioid-related mortality in that region. We also find suggestive evidence that broadening naloxone access increased the use of fentanyl, a particularly potent opioid. While naloxone has great potential as a harm-reduction strategy, our analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that broadening access to naloxone encourages riskier behaviors with respect to opioid abuse.},

We find robust evidence that the program reduced reports of targeted, less serious crimes (e.g., trespassing, public disorder, and resisting arrest) by 34\% and had no detectable effect on more serious crimes. The sharp reduction in targeted crimes reflects the fact that health-focused first responders are less likely to report individuals they serve as criminal offenders and the spillover benefits of the program (e.g., reducing crime during hours when the program was not in operation).},

	abstract = {Background
Abusive and violent policing is an important determinant of health for people who inject drugs (PWID), which has been linked to structural vulnerability. However, further exploration of the intersectional nature of this vulnerability is warranted. California's Central Valley is a largely rural/suburban and politically conservative area, with high rates of injection drug use and overdose mortality, where rates of abusive policing of PWID have not been characterized.
Methods
We assessed self-reported experiences of abusive policing using a sequential mixed-methods approach, consisting of n = 54 in-depth qualitative interviews followed by a respondent driven survey of n = 494 PWID. Qualitative conclusions were used to guide the development a novel quantitative framework to explore intersectional structural vulnerability, drawing on UpSet visualization and multivariable logistic regression.
Results
Qualitative analysis suggests that abusive policing is not random or isolated; instead it can be understood in the context of routinized police harassment of PWID, which can escalate into physical or other forms of violence. These cycles are mediated by various forms of social disadvantage—often articulated through the frame of “looking like a drug user”—with deep connections to markers of race, class, gender, occupation and other elements of personal identity. Quantitative results confirm high frequency of abusive encounters with police, including physical violence (42\%), verbal abuse (62\%), sexual violence (9\%), and the confiscation of new/unused syringes (39\%). Females report higher rates of sexual violence and exploitation (aOR= 4.2; 95\% CI: 2.1–9.0) and males report higher rates of physical violence (aOR=3.6; 95\% CI: 2.4–5.6) and all other outcomes. Experiencing homelessness, having traded sex, and living in a rural zip code, are independently associated with numerous forms of police abuse. Intersectional analysis reveals clusters of individuals with highly elevated vulnerability, and in general, having a greater number of vulnerability factors was associated with increased odds of police abuse.
Conclusions
We find that structural vulnerability is linked—in a highly intersectional manner—with experiencing abusive police encounters among PWID in California's Central Valley. Monitoring, prevention, and response to deleterious law enforcement practices must be integrated into structural interventions to protect vulnerable groups. Reform is especially urgent in rural/suburban areas that are increasingly important focal points to reduce social and health harms associated with injection drug use.},

	shorttitle = {Street-{Level} {Bureaucracy}},
	abstract = {First published in 1980, Street-Level Bureaucracy received critical acclaim for its insightful study of how public service workers, in effect, function as policy decision makers, as they wield their considerable discretion in the day-to-day implementation of public programs. Three decades later, the need to bolster the availability and effectiveness of healthcare, social services, education, and law enforcement is as urgent as ever. In this thirtieth anniversary expanded edition, Michael Lipsky revisits the territory he mapped out in the first edition to reflect on significant policy developments over the last several decades. Despite the difficulties of managing these front-line workers, he shows how street-level bureaucracies can be and regularly are brought into line with public purposes. Street-level bureaucrats—from teachers and police officers to social workers and legal-aid lawyers—interact directly with the public and so represent the frontlines of government policy. In Street-Level Bureaucracy, Lipsky argues that these relatively low-level public service employees labor under huge caseloads, ambiguous agency goals, and inadequate resources. When combined with substantial discretionary authority and the requirement to interpret policy on a case-by-case basis, the difference between government policy in theory and policy in practice can be substantial and troubling. The core dilemma of street-level bureaucrats is that they are supposed to help people or make decisions about them on the basis of individual cases, yet the structure of their jobs makes this impossible. Instead, they are forced to adopt practices such as rationing resources, screening applicants for qualities their organizations favor, "rubberstamping" applications, and routinizing client interactions by imposing the uniformities of mass processing on situations requiring human responsiveness. Occasionally, such strategies work out in favor of the client. But the cumulative effect of street-level decisions made on the basis of routines and simplifications about clients can reroute the intended direction of policy, undermining citizens' expectations of evenhanded treatment. This seminal, award-winning study tells a cautionary tale of how decisions made by overburdened workers translate into ad-hoc policy adaptations that impact peoples' lives and life opportunities. Lipsky maintains, however, that these problems are not insurmountable. Over the years, public managers have developed ways to bring street-level performance more in line with agency goals. This expanded edition of Street-Level Bureaucracy underscores that, despite its challenging nature, street-level work can be made to conform to higher expectations of public service.},

Here, we report on field observations of police officers handling mental health-related encounters in Chicago. Findings confirm these encounters often occur in the “gray zone,” where the problems at hand do not call for formal or legalistic interventions. In examining how police resolved such situations, we observed three core features of police work: (a) accepting temporary solutions to chronic vulnerability, (b) using local knowledge to guide decision making, and (c) negotiating peace with complainants and call subjects. Findings imply the need to advance field-based studies using systematic social observations of gray zone decision making within and across distinct geographic and place-based contexts. Policy implications for supporting police interventions are also discussed.},

Manning draws on decades of fieldwork to investigate how law enforcement works on the ground and in the symbolic realm, and why most efforts to reform the way police work have failed so far.  Manning begins by developing a model of policing as drama—a way of communicating various messages to the public in an effort to enforce moral boundaries. Unexpected outcomes, or contingencies, continually rewrite the plot of this drama, requiring officers to adjust accordingly. New information technologies, media scrutiny and representations, and community policing also play important roles, and Manning studies these influences in detail. He concludes that their impacts have been quite limited, because the basic structure of policing—officer assessments based on encounters during routine patrols—has remained unchanged. For policing to really change, Manning argues, its focus will need to shift to prevention.  Written with precision and judiciously argued, Policing Contingencies will be of value to scholars of sociology, criminology, information technology, and cultural theory.},

To test these hypotheses, we examine 1990 census and crime data for load areas in the city of Columbus, Ohio.

Although both popular accounts and sociological theory predict that immigration should increase crime in areas where immigrants settle, this study of Miami, El Paso, and San Diego neighborhoods shows that, controlling for other influences, immigration generally does not increase levels of homicide among Latinos and African Americans. Our results not only challenge stereotypes of the “criminal immigrant” but also the core criminological notion that immigration, as a social process, disorganizes communities and increases crime.},

Few efforts have been made, however, to "make sense" of this literature. A "meta-analysis" was undertaken to determine the relative effects of macro-level predictors of crime. Indicators of "concentrated disadvantage" (e.g., racial heterogeneity, poverty, and family disruption) are among the strongest and most stable predictors. Except for incarceration, variables indicating increased use of the criminal justice system (e.g., policing and get-tough policy effects) are among the weakest. Across all studies, social disorganization and resource/economic deprivation theories receive strong empirical support; anomie/strain, social support/social altruism, and routine activity theories receive moderate support; and deterrence/rational choice and subcultural theories receive weak support.},

Some would have us believe that we act solely as individuals choosing our own fates regardless of our surroundings, while other theories place us at the mercy of global forces beyond our control. These two perspectives dominate contemporary views of society, but by rejecting the importance of place they are both deeply flawed. Based on one of the most ambitious studies in the history of social science, Great American City argues that communities still matter because life is decisively shaped by where you live. To demonstrate the powerfully enduring impact of place, Robert J. Sampson presents here the fruits of over a decade’s research in Chicago combined with his own unique personal observations about life in the city, from Cabrini Green to Trump Tower and Millennium Park to the Robert Taylor Homes. He discovers that neighborhoods influence a remarkably wide variety of social phenomena, including crime, health, civic engagement, home foreclosures, teen births, altruism, leadership networks, and immigration. Even national crises cannot halt the impact of place, Sampson finds, as he analyzes the consequences of the Great Recession and its aftermath, bringing his magisterial study up to the fall of 2010. Following in the influential tradition of the Chicago School of urban studies but updated for the twenty-first century, Great American City is at once a landmark research project, a commanding argument for a new theory of social life, and the story of an iconic city.},

	abstract = {This book presents the results of 20 years of ecological research into the nature of the relationship between the distribution of delinquency and the pattern of physical structure and social organization of 21 American cities. Uniform findings in every city confirm the hypothesis that the physical deterioration of residential areas accompanied by social disorganization is greatest in a central zone in the business district, intermediate in a middle zone, and lowest in the other zones, and that there is a progressive decline in the incidence of delinquency from the innermost zone where it is most concentrated to the peripheral areas. Delinquency is found to be highly correlated with changes in population, inadequate housing, poverty, presence of Negroes and foreign-born, tuberculosis, mental disorders, and adult criminality. The common basic factor is social disorganization or the absence of community effort to cope with these conditions. Causation of juvenile delinquency is to be sought more in terms of the community than of the individual. 107 maps pertaining to the cities studied and 118 tables relating to population and delinquency rates are included as well as a chapter describing the Chicago Area Project as a demonstration of the effective mobilization of community forces to combat delinquency and crime.

In prominent alternative theories, the delinquent appears either as a frustrated striver forced into delinquency by his acceptance of the goals common to us all, or as an innocent foreigner attempting to obey the rules of a society that is not in position to make the law or define conduct as good or evil. Hirschi analyzes a large body of data on delinquency collected in Western Contra Costa County, California, contrasting throughout the assumptions of the strain, control, and cultural deviance theories. He outlines the assumptions of these theories and discusses the logical and empirical difficulties attributed to each of them. Then draws from sources an outline of social control theory, the theory that informs the subsequent analysis and which is advocated here.Often listed as a Citation Classic, Causes of Delinquency retains its force and cogency with age. It is an important volume and a necessary addition to the libraries of sociologists, criminologists, scholars and students in the area of delinquency.},

	abstract = {By articulating a general theory of crime and related behavior, the authors present a new and comprehensive statement of what the criminological enterprise should be about. They argue that prevalent academic criminology—whether sociological, psychological, biological, or economic—has been unable to provide believable explanations of criminal behavior. The long-discarded classical tradition in criminology was based on choice and free will, and saw crime as the natural consequence of unrestrained human tendencies to seek pleasure and to avoid pain. It concerned itself with the nature of crime and paid little attention to the criminal. The scientific, or disciplinary, tradition is based on causation and determinism, and has dominated twentieth-century criminology. It concerns itself with the nature of the criminal and pays little attention to the crime itself. Though the two traditions are considered incompatible, this book brings classical and modern criminology together by requiring that their conceptions be consistent with each other and with the results of research. The authors explore the essential nature of crime, finding that scientific and popular conceptions of crime are misleading, and they assess the truth of disciplinary claims about crime, concluding that such claims are contrary to the nature of crime and, interestingly enough, to the data produced by the disciplines themselves. They then put forward their own theory of crime, which asserts that the essential element of criminality is the absence of self-control. Persons with high self-control consider the long-term consequences of their behavior; those with low self-control do not. Such control is learned, usually early in life, and once learned, is highly resistant to change. In the remainder of the book, the authors apply their theory to the persistent problems of criminology. Why are men, adolescents, and minorities more likely than their counterparts to commit criminal acts? What is the role of the school in the causation of delinquincy? To what extent could crime be reduced by providing meaningful work? Why do some societies have much lower crime rates than others? Does white-collar crime require its own theory? Is there such a thing as organized crime? In all cases, the theory forces fundamental reconsideration of the conventional wisdom of academians and crimina justic practitioners. The authors conclude by exploring the implications of the theory for the future study and control of crime.},

Indeed, the Essai may be considered the book that launched modern empirical social science, for the questions raised and the methods Guerry developed to try to answer them. Guerry's data consist of a large number of variables recorded for each of the departments of France in the 1820-1830s and therefore involve both multivariate and geographical aspects. In addition to historical interest, these data provide the opportunity to ask how modern methods of statistics, graph ics, thematic cartography and geovisualization can shed further light on the questions he raised.

However, the evaluation evidence reviewed by the NAS, which largely comes from case studies of carefully managed proactive initiatives, does not provide a basis for estimating how extensively these practices are used or whether they are used in the most effective ways. Accordingly, it is unclear whether police proactivity as practiced on an everyday basis reflects optimal strategies and implementation methods as recommended by the NAS. This study addresses this knowledge gap by analyzing almost 2 million computer-aided dispatch records from four agencies and systematically observing 84 officers for more than 180 hours to better understand the empirical realities of police proactivity. The findings indicate a major difference between the types of proactive interventions supported by research and the practice of everyday police proactivity. Specifically, proactive policing practices are limited in scope and are often implemented in less than optimal ways. A large proportion of proactive activities are also not recorded, rewarded, or supervised, indicating that patrol commanders may have little control over, or awareness of, proactive deployment. From an evidence-based policing perspective, much more effort is needed to record and track proactivity to measure its impacts (both positive and negative) and align it with what we now know about effective proactive activity from research.},

In The Criminology of Place, David Weisburd, Elizabeth Groff, and Sue-Ming Yang present a new and different way of looking at the crime problem by examining why specific streets in a city have specific crime trends over time. Based on a 16-year longitudinal study of crime in Seattle, Washington, the book focuses our attention on small units of geographic analysis-micro communities, defined as street segments. Half of all Seattle crime each year occurs on just 5-6 percent of the city's street segments, yet these crime hot spots are not concentrated in a single neighborhood and street by street variability is significant. Weisburd, Groff, and Yang set out to explain why. The Criminology of Place shows how much essential information about crime is inevitably lost when we focus on larger units like neighborhoods or communities. Reorienting the study of crime by focusing on small units of geography, the authors identify a large group of possible crime risk and protective factors for street segments and an array of interventions that could be implemented to address them. The Criminology of Place is a groundbreaking book that radically alters traditional thinking about the crime problem and what we should do about it.},

I argue that criminology should take another turn in direction, focusing on microgeographic hot spots. By examining articles published in Criminology, I show that only marginal attention has been paid to this area of study to date—often termed the criminology of place. I illustrate the potential utility of a turning point by examining the law of crime concentration at place, which states that for a defined measure of crime at a specific microgeographic unit, the concentration of crime will fall within a narrow bandwidth of percentages for a defined cumulative proportion of crime. By providing the first cross-city comparison of crime concentration using a common geographic unit, the same crime type, and examining a general crime measure, I find strong support for a law of crime concentration. I also show that crime concentration stays within a narrow bandwidth across time, despite strong volatility in crime incidents. By drawing from these findings, I identify several key research questions for future study. In conclusion, I argue that a focus on the criminology of place provides significant opportunity for young scholars and has great promise for advancing criminology as a science.},

When law enforcement officers used their discretion to divert individuals into LEAD rather than arrest, those individuals had significantly fewer felony and misdemeanor arrests and felony cases, in comparison to a propensity score matched group. The focus group and interview data describe that the collaboration, the warm handoff, and LEAD’s harm reduction principles were mechanisms of success.

	abstract = {Purpose
The physical environment and social determinants of health have been shown to influence health behaviors including drug use and fatal drug overdose. The current research examines the effects of the built environment, social determinants of health measures and aggregated risk from the built environment at neighborhood-level on drug overdose death locations in Miami-Dade County, Florida.
Methods
Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM) was used to assess the place features risk factors that significantly increase the risk of drug overdose death spatially in Miami-Dade County ZIP Code Tabulation Areas, Florida from 2014 to 2019. An aggregated neighborhood risk of fatal drug overdose measure was developed by averaging the risk per grid cell from the RTM within census block groups each year. Six logistic and zero-inflated regression models were built to examine the effects of three indices of incident-specific social determinants of health (IS-SDH) measures and aggregated risk measures separately, and simultaneously on drug overdose death locations each year.
Results
Seven place features including parks, bus stops, restaurants and grocery stores were significantly related to the occurrence of fatal drug overdoses. When examined separately, one or more indices of the IS-SDH were significant covariates of drug overdose locations in some years. When examined simultaneously, the three indices of the IS-SDH and aggregated risk of fatal drug overdose measure could be all significant in certain years.
Conclusions
The patterns of high-risk areas and place features identified from the RTM related to drug overdose deaths may be used to inform the placement of treatment and prevention resources. A multi-factor approach that combines an aggregated neighborhood risk measure reflecting the risk from the built environment and the incident-specific social determinants of health measures can be used to identify the drug overdose death locations in certain years.},

	abstract = {Background
Drug overdose is a leading cause of unintentional death in the United States and has contributed significantly to a decline in life expectancy during recent years. To combat this health issue, this study aims to identify the leading neighborhood-level predictors of drug overdose and develop a model to predict areas at the highest risk of drug overdose using geographic information systems and machine learning (ML) techniques.
Method
Neighborhood-level (block group) predictors were grouped into three domains: socio-demographic factors, drug use variables, and protective resources. We explored different ML algorithms, accounting for spatial dependency, to identify leading predictors in each domain. Using geographically weighted regression and the best-performing ML algorithm, we combined the output prediction of three domains to produce a final ensemble model. The model performance was validated using classification evaluation metrics, spatial cross-validation, and spatial autocorrelation testing.
Results
The variables contributing most to the predictive model included the proportion of households with food stamps, households with an annual income below \$35,000, opioid prescription rate, smoking accessories expenditures, and accessibility to opioid treatment programs and hospitals. Compared to the error estimated from normal cross-validation, the generalized error of the model did not increase considerably in spatial cross-validation. The ensemble model using ML outperformed the GWR method.
Conclusion
This study identified strong neighborhood-level predictors that place a community at risk of experiencing drug overdoses, as well as protective factors. Our findings may shed light on several specific avenues for targeted intervention in neighborhoods at risk for high drug overdose burdens.},

	abstract = {Background: Training law enforcement ofﬁcers (LEOs) to administer naloxone to opioid overdose victims is increasingly part of comprehensive efforts to reduce opioid overdose deaths. Such efforts could yield positive interactions between LEOs and community members and might ultimately help lower overdose death rates.
Methods: We evaluated a pilot LEO naloxone program by (1) assessing opioid overdose knowledge and attitudes (competency in responding, concerns about naloxone administration, and attitudes towards overdose victims) before and after a 30 min training on overdose and naloxone administration, and (2) conducting qualitative interviews with LEOs who used naloxone to respond to overdose emergencies after the training.
Results: Eighty-one LEOs provided pre- and post-training data. Nearly all (89\%) had responded to an overdose while serving as an LEO. Statistically signiﬁcant increases were observed in nearly all items measuring opioid overdose knowledge (p’s = 0.04 to {\textless}0.0001). Opioid overdose competencies (p {\textless} 0.001) and concerns about naloxone administration (p {\textless} 0.001) signiﬁcantly improved after the training, while there was no change in attitudes towards overdose victims (p = 0.90). LEOs administered naloxone 11 times; nine victims survived and three of the nine surviving victims made at least one visit to substance abuse treatment as a result of a LEO-provided referral. Qualitative data suggest that LEOs had generally positive experiences when they employed the skills from the training.
Conclusions: Training LEOs in naloxone administration can increase knowledge and conﬁdence in managing opioid overdose emergencies. Perhaps most importantly, training LEOs to respond to opioid overdose emergencies may have positive effects for LEOs and overdose victims.},

A nonrandomized controlled evaluation was conducted to examine LEAD eﬀects on criminal recidivism (i.e., arrests, criminal charges). The sample included 318 people suspected of low-level drug and prostitution activity in downtown Seattle: 203 received LEAD, and 115 experienced the system-as-usual control condition. Analyses were conducted using logistic generalized estimating equation models over both the shorter term (i.e., six months prior and subsequent to evaluation entry) and longer term (i.e., two years prior to the LEAD start date through July 2014). Compared to controls, LEAD participants had 60\% lower odds of arrest during the six months subsequent to evaluation entry; and both a 58\% lower odds of arrest and 39\% lower odds of being charged with a felony over the longer term. These statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in arrests and felony charges for LEAD versus control participants indicated positive eﬀects of the LEAD program on recidivism.},

However, the basic interrupted time series design cannot exclude confounding due to co-interventions or other events occurring around the time of the intervention. One approach to minimizse potential confounding from such simultaneous events is to add a control series so that there is both a before-after comparison and an intervention-control group comparison. A range of different types of controls can be used with interrupted time series designs, each of which has associated strengths and limitations. Researchers undertaking controlled interrupted time series studies should carefully consider a priori what confounding events may exist and whether different controls can exclude these or if they could introduce new sources of bias to the study.

	abstract = {Method: We evaluate the effect of California's Proposition 99 (passed in 1988) for reducing cigarette sales, by comparing California to other states not exposed to smoking reduction initiatives. We compare ITSAMATCH results to 2 commonly used matching approaches, synthetic controls (SYNTH), and regression adjustment; SYNTH reweights nontreated units to make them comparable to the treated unit, and regression adjusts covariates directly. Methods are compared by assessing covariate balance and treatment effects.
Results: Both ITSAMATCH and SYNTH achieved covariate balance and estimated similar treatment effects. The regression model found no treatment effect and produced inconsistent covariate adjustment.
Conclusions: While the matching framework achieved results comparable to SYNTH, it has the advantage of being technically less complicated, while producing statistical estimates that are straightforward to interpret. Conversely, regression adjustment may “adjust away” a treatment effect. Given its advantages, ITSAMATCH should be considered as a primary approach for evaluating treatment effects in multiple‐group time‐series analysis.},

	abstract = {Often, when conducting programme evaluations or studying the effects of policy changes, researchers may only have access to aggregated time series data, presented as observations spanning both the pre- and post-intervention periods. The most basic analytic model using these data requires only a single group and models the intervention effect using repeated measurements of the dependent variable. This model controls for regression to the mean and is likely to detect a treatment effect if it is sufﬁciently large. However, many potential sources of bias still remain. Adding one or more control groups to this model could strengthen causal inference if the groups are comparable on pre-intervention covariates and level and trend of the dependent variable. If this condition is not met, the validity of the study ﬁndings could be called into question. In this paper we describe a propensity score-based weighted regression model, which overcomes these limitations by weighting the control groups to represent the average outcome that the treatment group would have exhibited in the absence of the intervention. We illustrate this technique studying cigarette sales in California before and after the passage of Proposition 99 in California in 1989. While our results were similar to those of the Synthetic Control method, the weighting approach has the advantage of being technically less complicated, rooted in regression techniques familiar to most researchers, easy to implement using any basic statistical software, may accommodate any number of treatment units, and allows for greater ﬂexibility in the choice of treatment effect estimators.},

	abstract = {Aims The transition from prison back into the community is particularly hazardous for drug-using offenders whose tolerance for heroin has been reduced by imprisonment. Studies have indicated an increased risk of drug-related death soon after release from prison, particularly in the ﬁrst 2 weeks. For precise, up-to-date understanding of these risks, a meta-analysis was conducted on the risk of drug-related death in weeks 1 + 2 and 3 + 4 compared with later 2-week periods in the ﬁrst 12 weeks after release from prison. Methods English-language studies were identiﬁed that followed up adult prisoners for mortality from time of index release for at least 12 weeks. Six studies from six prison systems met the inclusion criteria and relevant data were extracted independently. Results These studies contributed a total of 69 093 person-years and 1033 deaths in the ﬁrst 12 weeks after release, of which 612 were drug-related. A three- to eightfold increased risk of drug-related death was found when comparing weeks 1 + 2 with weeks 3–12, with notable heterogeneity between countries: United Kingdom, 7.5 (95\% CI: 5.7–9.9); Australia, 4.0 (95\% CI: 3.4–4.8); Washington State, USA, 8.4 (95\% CI: 5.0–14.2) and New Mexico State, USA, 3.1 (95\% CI: 1.3–7.1). Comparing weeks 3 + 4 with weeks 5–12, the pooled relative risk was: 1.7 (95\% CI: 1.3–2.2). Conclusions These ﬁndings conﬁrm that there is an increased risk of drug-related death during the ﬁrst 2 weeks after release from prison and that the risk remains elevated up to at least the fourth week.},

We sought to identify risk and protective factors for all-cause and accidental poisoning (overdose) death. Design Nested case–control study of people released from prison.

Participants Cases (699 all-cause deaths, of which 88 were among women, and 196 additional overdose deaths, of which 76 were among women) between 1999 and 2009 matched 1 : 1 to controls on sex, age and year of release using risk set sampling. Measurements Prison medical charts were abstracted for clinical information. Independent associations between clinical characteristics and all-cause and overdose mortality were assessed using conditional logistic regression. Findings Key independent risk factors for all-cause mortality included homelessness [odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI) = 1.06, 2.23], injection drug use (OR = 1.54, 95\% CI = 1.16, 2.06), tobacco use (OR = 1.51, 95\% CI = 1.07, 2.13), cirrhosis (OR = 4.42, 95\% CI = 1.63, 11.98) and psychiatric medications before release (OR = 2.38, 95\% CI = 1.71, 3.30).

At present, the policing ﬁeld lacks a comprehensive measure that encompasses the multidimensional role of the police in the community while giving suitable weight to the serious crimes that are of greatest public concern. Existing costs of crime and harm indices rated through sentencing structures potentially ignore inadvertent harms perceived to affect communities such as the consequences of certain police activities. This article introduces an index of harm based on sentencing guidelines that covers a wider array of offences than costs of crime estimates or many previous sentencing guidelines, and demonstrates its applicability with a case study from the city of Philadelphia, PA, USA. The article then examines the more polemic merits of including a measure of police investigative activity (pedestrian and trafﬁc stops) as a potential harm experienced by a community. The article demonstrates, by examining police districts within Philadelphia, that signiﬁcant variations of harm proﬁle exist at the police district level.},

	abstract = {Background  An emergent intervention to address the opioid epidemic is the use of multidisciplinary outreach teams which connect an individual in the community to healthcare resources after the experience of an opioid overdose. While these interventions are receiving federal funding, less is known empirically to inform future interventions. Understanding the process and outcomes of these interventions is advisable due to the novel partnerships of public health and law enforcement agencies who sometimes hold divergent goals. The objective of the present review was to describe program structure and evaluated outcomes of community-based post-overdose interventions.
Results  A search of PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science yielded 5 peer-reviewed articles that detail the implementation and outcomes of interventions delivered in the United States published from 2001 to July 2021. Most interventions used a multidisciplinary outreach team and referenced first responder data to contact individuals who recently experienced an overdose at their residence. Services offered often included referral to substance use treatment, recovery coaches, and social services. Method of outreach, evaluation measures, and outcomes varied. From the available literature, facilitators of program engagement included communication, information sharing, and leadership buy-in among multidisciplinary partners.
Conclusions  Future studies could benefit from exploration of service provision in rural areas, for family affected by overdose, and for minoritized populations. Community-based post-overdose interventions utilizing a law enforcement partnership are emergent with promising yet limited examples in empirical literature.},

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of publications reporting on rigorous evaluations of systems-level interventions to address provider and patient/public behavior and prevent prescription and illicit opioid overdose. A total of 251 studies were reviewed. Interventions studied included 1) state legislation and regulation, 2) prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), 3) insurance strategies, 4) clinical guideline implementation, 5) provider education, 6) health system interventions, 7) naloxone education and distribution, 8) safe storage and disposal, 9) public education, 10) community coalitions, and 11) interventions employing public safety and public health collaborations.
Results: The quality of evidence supporting selected interventions was low to moderate. Interventions with the strongest evidence include PDMP and pain clinic legislation, insurance strategies, motivational interviewing in clinical settings, feedback to providers on opioid prescribing behavior, intensive school and family-based programs, and patient education in the clinical setting.
Conclusions: Although evidence is growing, further high-quality research is needed. Investigators should aim to identify strategies that can prevent overdose, as well as influence public, patient, and provider behavior. Identifying which strategies are most effective at addressing prescription compared to illicit opioid misuse and overdose could be fruitful, as well as investigating synergistic effects and unintended consequences.},

They also argued that the ultimate causes of crime were similar for both Whites and Blacks, leading to what has been labeled the thesis of “racial invariance.” In light of the large scale social changes of the past two decades and the renewed political salience of race and crime in the United States, this paper reassesses and updates evidence evaluating the theory. In so doing, we clarify key concepts from the original thesis, delineate the proper context of validation, and address new challenges. Overall, we find that the accumulated empirical evidence provides broad but qualified support for the theoretical claims. We conclude by charting a dual path forward: an agenda for future research on the linkages between race and crime, and policy recommendations that align with the theory’s emphasis on neighborhood level structural forces but with causal space for cultural factors.},

Methods A vignette-based cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted. As a cluster, participants were randomly selected and then randomly assigned to one of the four conditions (non-BWC, unawareness of BWC, awareness of BWC, and notification of BWC). Participants in the experimental conditions (i.e., unawareness of BWC, awareness of BWC, and notification of BWC) viewed a video of a real traffic stop in which the officer used a BWC. The data were obtained from a survey about participants’ perceptions. A one-way ANOVA test for bivariate analysis and a hierarchical generalized linear model for multivariate analysis were conducted.
Results  Compared with the control condition, the three experimental conditions significantly improved encounter-based citizen perceptions. Compared with unawareness of BWC, notification of BWC significantly improved the perceptions of procedural justice and police lawfulness, while awareness of BWC significantly improved the perceptions of police lawfulness.
Conclusions  BWC awareness improves citizen encounter-based perceptions. Police should notify citizens of the use of BWCs to increase the effectiveness of BWCs.},

	abstract = {Over the past twenty years, many US cities have seen urban revitalization and population changes associated with an increased desire for urban living among the affluent. As inner-city neighborhoods become gentrified, they are more likely to witness the construction of new buildings and homes, the conversion of industrial spaces to mixed-used developments, expanded access to mass transit, and the arrival of coffee shops and other urban amenities. In this review, we take stock of what is known about the impact of gentrification and land-use changes on neighborhood crime. We summarize research conducted since the period of urban revitalization that started in the 1990s as well as studies that have a quasi-experimental design. We find that gentrification and associated changes to land use tend to reduce crime in neighborhoods. Our findings are tempered by the need for greater conceptual clarity on how to measure when a neighborhood has gentrified and a clearer examination of the spatial displacement of crime. We conclude with a discussion on the need for criminologists to partner with urban planners to study how changes in the land use of cities can be made to generate crime reductions that benefit all places and, finally, detail some promising directions for future research.},

The annual counts of neighborhood coffee shops provide an on–the–ground measure of a particular form of economic development and changing consumption patterns that tap into central theoretical frames within the gentrification literature. Our analysis augments commonly used Census variables with the annual number of coffee shops in a neighborhood to assess the influence of gentrification on three–year homicide and street robbery counts in Chicago. Longitudinal Poisson regression models with neighborhood fixed effects reveal that gentrification is a racialized process, in which the effect of gentrification on crime is different for White gentrifying neighborhoods than for Black gentrifying neighborhoods. An increasing number of coffee shops in a neighborhood is associated with declining homicide rates for White, Hispanic, and Black neighborhoods; however, an increasing number of coffee shops is associated with increasing street robberies in Black gentrifying neighborhoods.},

              Longitudinal studies of the relationship between neighborhood change and changes in crime typically focus exclusively on the net level of change in key socio-demographic characteristics.
            
            
              Methods
              We instead propose a demographic accounting strategy that captures the composition of neighborhood change: our measures capture which types of people are more likely to leave, stay, or enter the neighborhood. We use data for 3,325 tracts in the Southern California region over nearly two decades of 2000–2010 and 2010–2017 and construct flow measures based on race/ethnicity; the length of residence of owners and renters; the age structure.
            
            
              Results
              These flow measures improve the predictive power of the models—implying important theoretical insights. Neighborhoods with higher percentages of middle-aged residents who recently entered the neighborhood exhibit larger increases in violent and property crime. The relative stability of those in the highest crime-prone ages (aged 15–29) is associated with the largest increases in violent and property crime. The greater loss of Black and Asian residents decreased crime while moderate outflows of Latinos increased crime. The mobility of long- and short-term renters was related to crime changes.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This new technique will likely encourage further theoretical innovation for the neighborhoods and crime literature.},

For example, McCarthy (Annu Rev Sociol 28:417–442, 2002) argues that rational choice theory, which allows persons great involvement in decision making, is more congenial with notions of human agency than others. It would appear from his argument that rational choice theory offers fertile ground to develop a clearly deﬁned role for human agency in criminal behavior. In this paper we have taken up McCarthy’s view and argue that an important part of what is human agency consists of thoughtfully reﬂective decision making. We outline four elements of thoughtfully reﬂective decision making, and claim that it is a characteristic that varies both across persons and within persons over time. It is in short the process by which good decisions are made because by using this process one increases the likelihood that choices made will be consistent with preferences. We develop a clear operational deﬁnition of thoughtfully reﬂective decision making and link it to the concept of human agency. We also articulate testable hypotheses about the short-term and longer-term implications of thoughtfully reﬂective decision making.

We review the recent empirical research on this question, which uses disparate methods, including field experiments and different models for observational data. To evaluate the causal claims made in these studies, we use a potential outcomes framework of causality. We conclude that, although there is some evidence for both broken windows and informal control theories, there is little consensus in the present research literature.

Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns. We also discuss a set of thorny methodological problems that plague the study of neighborhood effects, with special attention to selection bias. We conclude with promising strategies and directions for future research, including experimental designs, taking spatial and temporal dynamics seriously, systematic observational approaches, and benchmark data on neighborhood social processes.},

In fact, it might be a crucial construct that could play an important role for understanding the link between social order and crime, for explaining the motivations behind compliance with the law, and in bridging the gap between macro- and micro explanations of crime. This paper reviews the empirical literature on whether legitimacy predicts crime. Findings suggest that many studies report a weak effect in the predicted direction. However, we also identify a number of limitations that future research should address. They include: 1) more consistent operationalisation of legitimacy, 2) better statistical control for potential confounding factors, 3) tests for alternative assumptions of the causal order between legitimacy and crime, 4) integration of macro- and micro-level research, and 5) more cross-cultural comparison.},

Mayoral partisanship does not aﬀect overall crime rates, arrests, or police employment and expenditures. However, it does inﬂuence the racial distribution of arrests. The election of a Democratic mayor decreases the Black share of arrests by a modest amount. This eﬀect is driven by decreases in arrests of Black individuals for both “drug crimes” and “other crimes.” This may be tied to police staﬃng choices, as electing a Democratic mayor also aﬀects police oﬃcer demographics: electing a Democratic mayor increases the Black share of police oﬃcers.

Methods: In order to extend prior research, this study relies on data from all counties in the state of Texas with a population of over 10,000 residents to provide a county-level analysis of the ability of macro-level self-control to predict three outcomes: violent crime, property crime, and unemployment rates.
Results: Exploratory factor analyses supported the existence of two macro-level dimensions of self-control, e.g., initiatory and inhibitory self-control. Subsequent correlational and predictive regression analyses provided evidence of the linkages between these macro-level indicators of self-control and a number of adverse outcomes.
Conclusions: The ﬁndings highlight the importance of continued inquiry into macro-level indicators of selfcontrol and the role of macro-level manifestations of self-control in policy and prevention initiatives to promote crime prevention and prevent adult adjustment problems such as unemployment.},

So far explanations have relied mostly on anecdotal evidence, usually broadly relying on Norbert Elias's theory of the "civilizing process." One major general theory of large-scale fluctuations in homicide rates, selfcontrol theory, offers a wide range of hypotheses that can be tested with rigorous quantitative analyses. A number of macro-level indicators for societal efforts to promote civility, self-discipline, and long-sightedness have been examined and appear to be strongly associated with fluctuations in homicide rates over the past six centuries.},

This research examines police officer attitudes about naloxone administration, drug treatment, and their role in handling drug-related incidents through an online survey. Although officers view themselves as adequately trained in administering naloxone/Narcan, almost half (43\%) believe there should be a limit on how often someone who overdoses receives Narcan and the majority (83\%) view naloxone/Narcan as providing an excuse to continue drug use. Officers also view drug treatment as ineffective. Negative attitudes differed as a function of frequency of overdose responses; officers who responded to more overdose calls and administered naloxone more frequently demonstrate more pessimistic attitudes toward drug treatment and the use of naloxone/Narcan. Officers more frequently exposed to drug overdoses need education and training about drug addiction issues to decrease stigma and elicit greater empathy toward people struggling with addiction.},

	abstract = {Background: Law enforcement is often the ﬁrst to respond to medical emergencies in the community, including overdose. Due to the nature of their job, ofﬁcers have also witnessed ﬁrst-hand the changing demographic of drug users and devastating effects on their community associated with the epidemic of nonmedical prescription opioid use in the United States. Despite this seminal role, little data exist on law enforcement attitudes toward overdose prevention and response.
Methods: We conducted key informant interviews as part of a 12-week Rapid Assessment and Response (RAR) process that aimed to better understand and prevent nonmedical prescription opioid use and overdose deaths in locations in Connecticut and Rhode Island experiencing overdose “outbreaks.” Interviews with 13 law enforcement ofﬁcials across three study sites were analyzed to uncover themes on overdose prevention and naloxone.
Results: Findings indicated support for law enforcement involvement in overdose prevention. Hesitancy around naloxone administration by laypersons was evident. Interview themes highlighted ofﬁcers’ feelings of futility and frustration with their current overdose response options, the lack of accessible local drug treatment, the cycle of addiction, and the pervasiveness of easily accessible prescription opioid medications in their communities. Overdose prevention and response, which for some ofﬁcers included law enforcement-administered naloxone, were viewed as components of community policing and good police-community relations.
Conclusion: Emerging trends, such as existing law enforcement medical interventions and Good Samaritan Laws, suggest the need for broader law enforcement engagement around this pressing public health crisis, even in suburban and small town locations, to promote public safety.},

	abstract = {Geographic information systems enable the study of the spatial distribution of gun violence in American cities. While sociodemographic characteristics and disinvestment patterns have been correlated to their presence, little work has examined spatio-temporal patterns among them. Understanding where shootings are more likely to be fatal may be of great value to criminologists, urban planners, and emergency department researchers. In this paper, we leveraged a crime database for Milwaukee spanning 2006 to 2015, geocoding every crime to its reported location. We ran kernel density analysis on each dataset to derive the relative density of gun homicides and non-fatal shootings. We then created space–time cubes for each crime type. These cubes were used with ESRI’s emerging hot spot analysis tool, highlighting different types of hot and cold spots. We appended these results to individual parcels to study the relationship between shooting hot or cold spots and sociodemographic characteristics. Lastly, we identified ‘islands’ with relatively fewer lethal shootings inside gun homicide hot spots, exploring reasons for their differentiation. While hot spots occurred primarily in African American neighborhoods, the worst areas were in more transitional neighborhoods, perhaps where disinvestment had not yet fully taken hold. Neighborhoods with the highest rate of homicides to total shootings included the most heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in Milwaukee, while lower rates were found in predominately African American neighborhoods. This work introduces a nuance into the discussion on policing gun violence, giving researchers and practitioners a finer lens in which to examine where and why gun violence occurs.},

	abstract = {The population size, population density and rate of urbanization are often crediting to contributing increasing a crime pattern specially in city. Urbanism model stating that the rise in urban crime and social problems is based on three population indicators namely; size, density and heterogeneity. The objective of this paper is to identify crime patterns of the hot spot urban crime location and the factors influencing the crime pattern relationship with population size, population density and rate of urbanization population. This study employed the ArcGIS Pro 2.4 tool such as Emerging Hot Spot Analysis (Space Time) to determine a crime pattern and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression to determine the factors influencing the crime patterns. By using these analyses tools, this study found that 54 (53\%) out of 102 total neighbourhood locations (2011-2017 years) had a 99 percent significance confidence level where z-score exceeded +2.58 with a small p-value (p {\textless}0.01) as the hot spot crime location. The result of data analysis using OLS regression explains that combination of exploratory variable model rate of urbanization and population size contributes 56 percent (R2 = 0.559) variance in crime index rate incident [F (3,39) = 18.779, p {\textless}0.01). While the population density (β = 0.045, t = 0.700, p{\textgreater} 0.10) is not a significance contributes to the change in crime index rate in Petaling and Klang district. The importance of the study is useful information for encouraging government and law enforcement agencies to promote safety and reduce risk of urban population crime areas.},

This study therefore uses meta-analytic techniques to examine major cross-national predictors of homicide to determine strengths and weaknesses in theory and design. The findings indicate several critical limitations to cross-national research, including biased sample composition, a lack of theoretical clarity in predictor operationalizations, and an overwhelming reliance on cross-sectional design. The predictors that showed the strongest mean effects were Latin American regional dummy variables, income inequality indicators and the Decommodification Index. Conversely, static population indicators, democracy indices, and measures of economic development had the weakest effects on homicide.},

Methods A longitudinal analysis of 16 years of crime data using street segments and intersections as the units of analysis. We use the k-means non-parametric cluster analysis technique considering eight crime types: assault, burglary, robbery, theft, theft of vehicle, theft from vehicle, other, and total crime.
Results The overall results for the individual crime types versus overall crime are similar: crime is highly concentrated regardless of crime type, most street segment and intersection trajectories are stable over time with the others decreasing, and most decreasing trajectories are in the same general areas. However, there are notable differences across crime types that need to be considered when attempting to understand spatial pattern changes and implement crime prevention initiatives.
Conclusions The law of crime concentration at places holds in Vancouver, Canada for disaggregated crime types in the context of spatial concentrations and their stability over time. However, notable differences exist across crime types that should be accounted for when developing theory or policy.},

	abstract = {Objectives To disaggregate the crime impact of visitor inﬂows. There is increasing evidence that visitors can make a major contribution to levels of crime in a given neighbourhood: crimes by visiting offenders may add to those committed by local offenders, while visitors (and their property) may provide local offenders with additional opportunities for crime.
Methods Using police-recorded crime data for a large Eastern Canadian city we determined whether individuals charged or chargeable for property and violent crimes were visitors or residents of census tracts (CT) where crimes had been committed. This information was combined with data from a large transportation survey, allowing us to estimate daily population ﬂows into each CT for four purposes (work, shopping, recreation, and education). Negative binomial regression models including spatial lags were used.
Results An increase in visitor inﬂow not only increases the number of visitors charged with crimes but also the number of local residents charged. These effects vary signiﬁcantly by visit purpose: more infractions are committed in tracts where visits are for recreation and, to a lesser extent, for shopping. Findings for work and education are mixed.
Conclusions One important implication of our results is that, because most studies of aggregate crime counts or rates fail to account for whether crimes have been committed by visitors or residents, previous research may have provided hasty, partial, or even erroneous explanations for crime concentrations.},

Methods The study includes inﬂation along with indicators of unemployment, GDP, income, consumer sentiment, and controls in error correction models of acquisitive crime covering the period from 1960 to 2012. Both short- and long-run effects of the predictors are estimated.
Results Among the economic indicators, only inﬂation has consistent and robust shortand long-run effects on year-over-year change in the offense types under consideration. Low inﬂation helps to explain why acquisitive crime did not increase during the 2008–2009 recession. Imprisonment rates also have robust long-run effects on change in acquisitive crime rates.
Conclusions Incorporating inﬂation into studies of crime and the economy can help to reduce the theoretical and empirical uncertainty that has long characterized this important research area in criminology.},

	abstract = {One of the primary components of state stability and order is that citizens consider those in power just and legitimate. Citizens who perceive the state as legitimate are likely to consider its institutions a valid source of morality and social control.  Theoretically, legitimacy should play an important role in criminal offending across countries. This link between state power and citizens—that is, legitimacy—has the potential to be an important social mechanism connecting state actions to individual criminal behaviours. With this in mind, this article explores how political legitimacy might affect levels of crime and violence across countries.  A lack of legitimacy may lead citizens to (1) reject the monopoly of physical force to employ self-help and/or (2) withdraw commitment from institutions, breaking down social control.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review:
This review provides an update on recent published literature on the rise of illicit fentanyls, risks for overdose, combinations with other substances, e.g. stimulants, consequences and treatment.

Recent findings:
Overdose due to illicit synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl and fentanyl analogs) continues to rise in the US both preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fentanyl-related overdose is rising in new geographic areas e.g. the western US. Stimulant-related overdose is also increasing nationwide driven by methamphetamine and cocaine. Polysubstance use, e.g. the use of a stimulant along with an opioid is driving stimulant-related overdose. Other medical consequences of injection drug use are rising including HIV and hepatitis C infections. Medication approaches to treating opioid use disorder remain the standard of care and there are new promising pharmacological approaches to treating methamphetamine use disorder.

Summary:
A ‘fourth wave’ of high mortality involving methamphetamine and cocaine use has been gathering force in the US. Availability and use of illicit fentanyls are still the major drivers of overdose deaths and the current rise in stimulant-related deaths appears entwined with the ongoing opioid epidemic.},

Using data on fatal traﬃc accidents from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the Centers for Disease Control and other administrative and survey data, we study the evolution of race-speciﬁc rates of fatal vehicle crashes. We document two potential causes: increases in time spent driving and drug use. Several other common causes of accidents, such as speeding and driving without a seat belt, do not exhibit race-speciﬁc increases.},

This study develops a new account of the cultural context of schooling decisions in disadvantaged neighborhoods based on the concept of cultural heterogeneity, defined as the presence of a wide array of competing and conflicting cultural models. It applies this concept to neighborhood effects on college enrollment. Using survey data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study shows that disadvantaged neighborhoods exhibit greater heterogeneity in college goals and that adolescents in more heterogeneous neighborhoods are less likely to act in concert with the college goals that they articulate.},

	abstract = {Policing, in its various forms and dimensions, has indelible and complex connections to public health. The conventional functions of policing—promoting social order, security, and crime prevention—are animated by many issues easily framed by a public health lens (e.g., forms of violence, mental illnesses, drug abuse, homelessness). Policing with a crime control focus can make public health worse by criminalizing vulnerable people and undermining access to health and harm reduction resources. Conversely, policing with a health focus can help link vulnerable people to treatment and recovery-oriented resources. Recognizing these connections, researchers have largely focused on the public health effects of policing by the public police, and practitioners have worked to transform the public police with population health in mind. This article suggests that although this focus on transforming the public police is necessary to the advancement of public health, it neglects to understand connections between private policing and public health. This conceptual article argues for the need to widen our focus beyond the public police when exploring policing’s relationship to public health. This expanded view, I suggest, is important to discovering the ways in which the health vulnerabilities of people and places may be compromised by different policing mentalities and practices. At the same time, it may provide clues about ways in which policing beyond the police might creatively and virtuously promote public health.},

	abstract = {Research Summary
We administered a survey experiment to a national sample of 1068 U.S. adults in April 2020 to determine the factors that shape support for various policing tactics in the midst of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Respondents were sharply divided in their views about pandemic policing tactics and were least supportive of policies that might limit public access to officers or reduce crime deterrence. Information about the health risks to officers, but not to inmates, significantly increased support for “precautionary” policing, but not for “social distance” policing. The information effect was modest, but may be larger if the information came from official sources and/or was communicated on multiple occasions. Other factors that are associated with attitudes toward pandemic policing include perceptions of procedural justice, altruistic fear, racial resentment, and authoritarianism.

Policy Implications
When considered together with other evidence, one clear takeaway from our study is that the public values police patrols and wants officers on call, even during pandemics. Another is that people who believe the police are procedurally just are more willing to trust officers in times of crisis and to empower them to enforce new laws, such as social distancing ordinances. Our results thus support continued procedural justice training for officers. A third takeaway is that agencies must proactively communicate with the public about the risks their officers face when responding to public health crises or natural disasters, in addition to how they propose to mitigate those risks. They must also be amenable to adjusting in response to community feedback.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered life globally during the first 4 months of 2020. Many countries, including the United States, responded to the pandemic by issuing stay-at-home orders/shelter-in-place orders (SaHOs/SiPOs) to their citizens. By April 2020, more than 90\% of the U.S. population was subject to an order. SaHOs/SiPOs raise a number of complex issues for the police, ranging from concerns about infringement of constitutional rights to potential sanctions for violations of an order. This article delves into the issues surrounding SaHOs/SiPOs and highlights their complexity for the police. First, we examine the “why the police?” question, and point to key features of their role which make enforcement of SaHOs/SiPOs the proper business of the police. Second, we examine the relevant legal doctrines that can serve as the basis for police actions against violators of orders, most notably the special needs doctrine. Last, we offer police legitimacy as a lens for viewing the appropriateness of police responses to violators of SaHOs/SiPOs.},

	abstract = {Background
Rates of fatal overdose (OD) from synthetic opioids rose nearly 60 \% from 2016 to 2018. 911 Good Samaritan Laws (GSLs) are an evidenced-based strategy for preventing OD fatality. This study describes patrol officers’ knowledge of their state’s GSL, experience with OD response, and their perspectives on strategies to prevent and respond to opioid OD.
Methods
An electronic survey assessed officers’ knowledge of state GSLs and experiences responding to OD. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical linear modeling were generated to examine differences in knowledge, preparedness, and endorsement of OD response efforts by experience with OD response.
Results
2,829 officers responded to the survey. Among those who had responded to an OD call in the past six months (n = 1,946), 37 \% reported administering naloxone on scene and 36 \% reported making an arrest. Most (91 \%) correctly reported whether their state had a GSL in effect. Only 26 \% correctly reported whether that law provides limited immunity from arrest. Fifteen percent of officers who had responded to an OD work in departments that do not carry naloxone. Compared with officers who had not responded to any OD calls, those who reported responding OD calls at least monthly and at least weekly, were significantly less likely to endorse OD response efforts.
Conclusion
Officers who respond to OD calls are generally receiving training and naloxone supplies to respond, but knowledge gaps and additional training needs persist. Additional training and strategies to relieve compassion fatigue among those who have more experience with OD response efforts may be indicated.},

Methods. We analyzed survey data on the past month co-use of prescription and illicit opioids and 12 nonopioid psychoactive drug classes from a national sample of 15 741 persons entering treatment of opioid use disorder.

Results. Past-month illicit opioid use increased from 44.8\% in 2011 to 70.1\% in 2018, while the use of prescription opioids alone dropped from 55.2\% to 29.9\%, yet overall remained high (94.5\% to 85.2\%). Past-month use of at least 1 nonopioid drug occurred in nearly all participants ({\textgreater} 90\%), with significant increases in methamphetamine (+85\%) and decreases across nonopioid prescription drug classes (range: −40\% to –68\%).

Conclusions. Viewing opioid trends in a “silo” ignores the fact not only that polysubstance use is ubiquitous among those with opioid use disorder but also that significant changes in polysubstance use should be monitored alongside opioid trends.

Public Health Implications. Treatment, prevention, and policymaking must address not only the supply and demand of a singular drug class but also the global nature of substance use overall.},

In order to revitalise and recommodify the prime spaces of the urban core, municipal leaders enlist the police to coercively relocate homeless people to marginal spaces. Unfortunately, little is known about the policing of homelessness in those areas into which homeless people are exiled. To address this lacuna, this article employs an ethnographic analysis of police patrols in Los Angeles’ Skid Row district. The findings demonstrate that, contrary to the dominant framework of exclusion, policing in marginal space takes on a disciplinary model of ‘recovery management’ designed to coercively shepherd homeless people into rehabilitative programmes and ameliorate the individual pathologies deemed responsible for homelessness. The article thus provides an analysis of how, why and with what consequences the policing of homelessness varies over space.},

Drawing on an analysis of 3.9 million 911 and 311 call records and participant observation alongside police officers, social workers, and homeless men and women residing on the streets of San Francisco, this article elaborates a model of “complaint-oriented policing” to explain additional causes and consequences of policing visible poverty. Situating the police within a broader bureaucratic field of poverty governance, I demonstrate how policing aimed at the poor can be initiated by callers, organizations, and government agencies, and how police officers manage these complaints in collaboration and conflict with health, welfare, and sanitation agencies. Expanding the conception of the criminalization of poverty, which is often centered on incarceration or arrest, the study reveals previously unforeseen consequences of move-along orders, citations, and threats that dispossess the poor of property, create barriers to services and jobs, and increase vulnerability to violence and crime.},

	abstract = {Objectives. To test the hypothesis that law enforcement efforts to disrupt local drug markets by seizing opioids or stimulants are associated with increased spatiotemporal clustering of overdose events in the surrounding geographic area.
Methods. We performed a retrospective (January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021), population-based cohort study using administrative data from Marion County, Indiana. We compared frequency and characteristics of drug (i.e., opioids and stimulants) seizures with changes in fatal overdose, emergency medical services nonfatal overdose calls for service, and naloxone administration in the geographic area and time following the seizures.
Results. Within 7, 14, and 21 days, opioid-related law enforcement drug seizures were signiﬁcantly associated with increased spatiotemporal clustering of overdoses within radii of 100, 250, and 500 meters. For example, the observed number of fatal overdoses was two-fold higher than expected under the null distribution within 7 days and 500 meters following opioid-related seizures. To a lesser extent, stimulant-related drug seizures were associated with increased spatiotemporal clustering overdose.
Conclusions. Supply-side enforcement interventions and drug policies should be further explored to determine whether they exacerbate an ongoing overdose epidemic and negatively affect the nation’s life expectancy. (Am J Public Health. 2023;113(7):750–758. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2023.307291)},

Using a unique aggregate-level data set, our empirical investigation reveals that, consistent with theoretical expectations, instrumental crime rates are significantly higher in areas where both a strong commitment to monetary success goals and a weak commitment to legitimate means exist. The tendency for this “goals/means” value complex to translate into higher rates of instrumental crime is reduced in the context of higher levels of welfare assistance and more frequent socializing among families. We also find that low levels of educational and economic attainment and high levels of inequality enhance the degree to which commitment to monetary success translates into instrumental crime. Overall, the findings are supportive of some claims by classic and contemporary anomie theories, but also they point to the need for further refinement of these perspectives and additional assessments of their empirical validity.},

This article reviews such theory and research within the context of four overlapping yet distinct lines of inquiry. First, we review scholarship that uses situational opportunity to understand individual victimization. Second, we discuss theory and research that link situational opportunity and high-crime places. Third, we explore scholarship that embraces a multicontextual opportunity perspective to understand crime and victimization events within neighborhood contexts. Fourth, we examine work that integrates situational opportunity into explanations of offending.},

	abstract = {Achieving a better understanding of the crime event in its spatio-temporal context is an important research area in criminology with major implications for improving policy and developing effective crime prevention strategies. However, signiﬁcant barriers related to data and methods exist for conducting this type of research. The research requires micro-level data about individual behavior that is difﬁcult to obtain and methods capable of modeling the dynamic, spatio-temporal interaction of offenders, victims, and potential guardians at the micro level. This paper presents simulation modeling as a method for addressing these challenges. Speciﬁcally, agent-based modeling, when integrated with geographic information systems, offers the ability to model individual behavior within a real environment. The method is demonstrated by operationalizing and testing routine activity theory as it applies to the crime of street robbery. Model results indicate strong support for the basic premise of routine activity theory; as time spent away from home increases, crime will increase. The strength of the method is in providing a research platform for translating theory into models that can be discussed, shared, tested and enhanced with the goal of building scientiﬁc knowledge.},

	abstract = {In the late 1940s Sutherland proposed that explanations of deviance and crime are either situational or dispositional, and that of the two, situational explanations might be the more important. Nonetheless, with a few notable exceptions, for the next four decades �ociologists focused on dispositional theories to the near total exclusion of situational variables. However, an increasing awareness of the theoretical limitations of strategies based only on dispositions has begun to encourage researchers to reconsider situational explanations. Most of the research that explicitly examines situational dynamics in producing crime has originated in experimental psychology, symbolic interactionism, or opportunity theories. Experimental research has helped to identify the situational correlates of crime and deviance, but lacks a theoretical framework for organizing its disparate empirical findings. Symbolic interaction research has emphasized the actor's role in defining and interpreting situations but thus far has not provided a theoretical link between motivation, opportunity, and crime. Opportunity theorists, especially those studying victimization, have made the most progress toward developing a situational theory of crime, but their emphasis on the victim rather than the offender imposes serious theoretical and methodological limitations.},

	abstract = {Background: As a response to mounting overdose fatalities, cross-agency outreach efforts have emerged to reduce future risk among overdose survivors. We aimed to characterize such programs in Massachusetts, with focus on team composition, approach, services provided, and funding.
Methods: We conducted a two-phase cross-sectional survey of public health and safety providers in Massachu­ setts. Providers in all 351 municipalities received a screening survey. Those with programs received a second, detailed survey. We analyzed responses using descriptive statistics.
Results: As of July 2019, 44 \% (156/351) of Massachusetts municipalities reported post-overdose outreach programs, with 75 \% (104/138) formed between 2016− 2019. Teams conducted home-based outreach 1–3 days following overdose events. Police departments typically supplied location information on overdose events (99 \%, 136/138) and commonly participated in outreach visits (86 \%, 118/138) alongside public health personnel, usually from community-based organizations. Teams provided or made referrals to services including inpatient addiction treatment, recovery support, outpatient medication, overdose prevention education, and naloxone. Some programs deployed law enforcement tools, including pre-visit warrant queries (57 \%, 79/138), which occasionally led to arrest (11 \%, 9/79). Many programs (81 \%, 112/138) assisted families with involuntary commitment to treatment – although this was usually considered an option of last resort. Most programs were grant-funded (76 \%, 104/136) and engaged in cross-municipal collaboration (94 \%, 130/138).
Conclusions: Post-overdose outreach programs have expanded, typically as collaborations between police and public health. Further research is needed to better understand the implications of involving police and to determine best practices for increasing engagement in treatment and harm reduction services and reduce sub­ sequent overdose.},

	abstract = {Background: With the current opioid epidemic impacting well over half of all counties across the United States, initiatives that encourage interagency collaboration between first responder organizations appear necessary to comprehensively address this crisis. Police, fire, and emergency medical services (EMS) are in a unique position to identify substance users and provide necessary resources to initiate treatment, yet there is not sufficient evidence of joint collaborative programs between law enforcement/first responders and healthcare providers.
Methods: In this scoping review we examine the current state of joint criminal justice and healthcare inter­ ventions, specifically, opioid and substance use pre-arrest initiatives via emergency first responders and police officers. We relied on data from the last 10 years across three major databases to assess the extent of criminal justice (CJ) and healthcare collaborations as a response to individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). We specifically focused on interventional programs between criminal justice first responders (pre-arrest) and healthcare providers where specific outcomes were documented.
Results: We identified only a small number (6) of studies involving interventions that met this criteria, sug­ gesting very limited study of joint interagency collaboration between law enforcement first responders and healthcare providers. Most had small samples, none were in the southern states, and all but one were initiated within the last 5 years.
Conclusions: Although studies describing joint efforts of early intercept criminal justice responses and healthcare interventions were few, existing studies suggest that such programs were effective at improving treatment re­ ferral and retention outcomes. Greater resources are needed to encourage criminal justice and healthcare col­ laboration and policies, making it easier to share data, refer patients, and coordinate care for individuals with OUD.},

	abstract = {Background: Elements of the physical environment have been shown to influence health behaviors including drug use and overdose mortality. Throughout the opioid epidemic in the United States, rural regions have been disproportionately affected by opioid overdose. Although the relationship between the urban built environment and opioid overdose has been established, little is known as to how trends may differ in rural areas.
Methods: Risk terrain modeling was used as a spatial analytical approach to assess environmental features that significantly increase the risk of opioid overdose in Jefferson County, Alabama. Spatial risk assessments were conducted for urban and rural regions as well as for the county as a whole. Criminogenic, opioidrelated, and community variables were included and compared across spatial risk models.
Results: The geographic context, rural or urban, influenced the relationship between environmental features and opioid overdose. In rural areas, community features such as bus stops and public schools were related to the occurrence of opioid overdose. In urban areas, inpatient treatment centers, transitional living facilities, express loan establishments, and liquor vendors were significantly related to the locations of opioid overdose.
Conclusion: Risk terrain modeling can be used to locate high-risk areas for opioid overdose while identifying factors that are contributing to the risk of events occurring in communities. The patterns of overdose risk differ in rural and urban contexts and may be used to inform the placement of treatment and prevention resources.},

This paper seeks to provide a differentiated view on reactions to naloxone that may have important implications for public health and harm reduction approaches.
Methods: Analyses from a qualitative investigation embedded within a 5-year Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) examined the risks and benefits of Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) training models (brief or extended training) in various populations of people who use opioids in New York City. The qualitative experiences (obtained through semi-structured interviews) of 46 people who use opioids and who were each involved in the delivery of naloxone, during 56 separate overdose events that occurred throughout 2016–2018, were studied. Situational analysis and inductive content analysis of interview data focused upon overdose reversals in an attempt to provide understandings of the various adverse effects associated with naloxone from their perspective. These analyses were supplemented by data sessions within the research team during which the findings obtained from situational analysis and inductive content analysis were reviewed and complemented by deductive (clinical) appraisals of the various physical and psychological effects associated with the overdose reversals.
Results: People who use opioids recognise three distinct and interconnected outcomes that may follow a successful opioid overdose reversal after intramuscular or intranasal administration of naloxone. These outcomes are here termed, (i) ‘rage’ (describing a wide range of angry, hostile and/or aggressive outbursts), (ii) ‘withdrawal symptoms,’ and (iii) ‘not rage, not withdrawal’ (i.e., a wide range of short-lived, ‘harmless’ conditions (such as temporary amnesia, mild emotional outbursts, or physical discomfort) that do not include rage or withdrawal symptoms).
Conclusion: Physical and psychological reactions to naloxone should not be understood exclusively as a consequence of acute, opioid-related, withdrawal symptoms. The three distinct and interconnected reversal outcomes identified in this study are considered from a harm reduction policy perspective and are further framed by concepts associated with ‘mediated toxicity’ (i.e., harm triggered by medicine). The overall conclusion is that harm reduction training programmes that are aligned to the policy and practice of take home naloxone may be strengthened by including awareness and training in how to best respond to ‘rage’ associated with overdose reversal following naloxone administration by people who use opioids and other laypersons.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To examine the relationship between prescription opioid rates and prescription opioid overdose deaths using spatial cluster and regression analyses.
Methods: Publicly available county-level data were obtained from the New York State Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013–2015. Kulldorﬀ's spatial scan statistic was used to investigate spatial clustering of New York State opioid prescription overdose death rates, as well as opioid prescription rates. A Poisson regression was used to analyze opioid prescriptions as a predictor of mortality accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the residuals.
Results: We report 1440 overdose mortalities and 26.8 million opioid prescriptions throughout New York State in 2013–2015. Multiple signiﬁcant clusters were found for both opioid prescription mortalities as well as prescriptions, although the locations of the elevated rates did not strongly overlap. Poisson regression showed a signiﬁcant, small, negative relationship between prescriptions and opioid mortalities, wherein for every 10,000 prescriptions increased, the number of opioid mortalities decreased approximately 0.12\%; therefore, essentially a null relationship.
Conclusions: Simply reducing the number of prescriptions may not be eﬀective in reducing prescription related mortality; although opioid prescription dosing information should be made available to engender a better evaluation of the epidemic. Geographical diﬀerences in opioid mortalities exist above and beyond what can be explained by prescription rate data; identifying these locations may help inform and guide public health interventions. Despite the recent reduction in opioid prescription rates, the overall population is still inundated with prescriptions.},

This study aims to (1) estimate the rates of opioid-related overdoses, (2) estimate the association of benzodiazepine co-ingestion with opioid-related deaths, (3) estimate associations between socioeconomic indicators and opioid-related deaths, and (4) map the distribution of fatal overdoses, in Orange County (OC), California. Methods: An ecologic study was conducted of all opioid- related deaths (1205 total) from 2010 to 2014 obtained from the OC Coroner Division database (1065 OC residents, 55 nonresidents, 85 OC homeless) (analyzed 2016–2017). Rates of opioid overdose, benzodiazepine co-ingestion prevalence, and associations with socioeconomic status (SES; education, poverty, median income) using ZIP code analysis in the residential and homeless communities were calculated. Results: Of 1205 deaths, 904 involved prescription-type opioids, 223 involved heroin, 39 involved both, and 39 not stated; 973 were classiﬁed unintentional overdoses, 180 suicides, and 52 undetermined; 49\% of cases involved benzodiazepines. Prescription-type opioid and heroin death rates for residents were 5.4/ 100,000 person-years (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 5.0–5.8) and 1.2/100,000 person-years (95\% CI: 1.0–1.4), respectively. Males, age group 45–54, and Caucasian race had the highest rate (13.6/100,000) of opioid mortality. The highest death rates were seen in homeless adults, at 136/ 100,000 person-years for prescription-type opioids (95\% CI: 99.0–185.5) and 156/100,000 person-years for heroin (95\% CI: 116.8–209.5). Conclusions: The burden of prescription-type opioid–related deaths in OC affects all demographics and levels of SES; there is a disproportionately high rate of opioid-related deaths in the OC homeless population.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective of our study was to incorporate stricter probable nonfatal opioid overdose case criteria, and advanced epidemiologic approaches to more reliably detect local clustering in nonfatal opioid overdose activity in EMS runs data.
Methods: Data were obtained using emsCharts for our study area in southwestern Pennsylvania from 2007 to 2018. Cases were identiﬁed as emergency medical service (EMS) responses where naloxone was administered, and improvement was noted in patient records between initial and ﬁnal Glasgow Coma Score. A subsample of all-cause EMS responses sites were used as controls and exact matched to cases on sex and 10-year-age category. Clustering was assessed using difference in Ripley's K function for cases and controls and Kulldorff scan statistics.
Results: Difference in K functions indicated no signiﬁcant difference in probable nonfatal overdose EMS runs across the study area compared to all-cause EMS runs. However, scan statistics did identify signiﬁcant local clustering of probable nonfatal overdose EMS runs (maximum likelihood ¼ 16.40, P ¼ 0.0003).
Conclusions: Results highlight relevance of EMS data to detect community-level overdose activity and promote reliable use through stricter case deﬁnition criteria and advanced methodological approaches. Techniques examined have the potential to improve targeted delivery of neighborhood-level public health response activities using a near real-time data source.},

Using data from the New York City Ofﬁce of the Chief Medical Examiner, we conducted a multilevel case control study using data on accidental overdose deaths as cases and non-overdose accidental deaths as controls. We used archival data from the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey and the Mayor’s Ofﬁce of Operations to assess characteristics of neighborhood external (e.g. dilapidation of buildings) and internal (e.g. quality of utilities in houses) built environment. Multilevel analyses were used to assess the relations between the neighborhood built environment and the likelihood of overdose death. Six out of the eight characteristics of the external environment studied and three out of the six characteristics of the internal environment studied were signiﬁcantly associated with the likelihood of fatal drug overdose in multilevel models after adjusting for individuallevel (age, race, sex) and neighborhood-level (income, drug use) variables. Deterioration of the built environment, particularly the external environment, is associated with an increased likelihood of fatal accidental drug overdose. Disinvestment in social resources, psychosocial stressors, neighborhood differences in response to a witnessed overdose, and differences in vulnerability to the adverse consequences of drug use in different neighborhoods may explain the observed associations.},

Neighborhood-level factors, such as income distribution, may be important determinants of overdose death independent of individual-level factors. We used data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to identify all cases of accidental deaths in New York City (NYC) in 1996 and individual-level covariates. We used 1990 US Census data to calculate the neighborhood-level income distribution. This multi-level case Á/control study included 725 accidental overdose deaths (cases) and 453 accidental deaths due to other causes (controls) in 59 neighborhoods in NYC. Overdose deaths were more likely in neighborhoods with higher levels of drug use and with more unequal income distribution. In multi-level models, income maldistribution was significantly associated with risk of overdose independent of individual-level variables (age, race, and sex) and neighborhood-level variables (income, drug use, and racial composition). The odds of death due to drug overdose were 1.63 Á/1.88 in neighborhoods in the least equitable decile compared with neighborhoods in the most equitable decile. Disinvestment in social and economic resources in unequal neighborhoods may explain this association. Public health interventions related to overdose risk should pay particular attention to highly unequal neighborhoods.},

	abstract = {Drug overdose is now the leading cause of unintentional death nationwide, driven by increased prescription opioid overdoses. To better understand urban opioid overdose deaths, this paper examines geographic, demographic, and clinical differences between heroin-related decedents and prescription opioid decedents in San Francisco from 2010 to 2012. During this time period, 331 individuals died from accidental overdose caused by opioids (310 involving prescription opioids and 31 involving heroin). Deaths most commonly involved methadone (45.9 \%), morphine (26.9 \%), and oxycodone (21.8 \%). Most deaths also involved other substances (74.9 \%), most commonly cocaine (35.3 \%), benzodiazepines (27.5 \%), antidepressants (22.7 \%), and alcohol (19.6 \%). Deaths were concentrated in a small, high-poverty, central area of San Francisco and disproportionately affected African-American individuals. Decedents in high-poverty areas were signiﬁcantly more likely to die from methadone and cocaine, whereas individuals from more afﬂuent areas were more likely die from oxycodone and benzodiazepines. Heroin decedents were more likely to be within a younger age demographic, die in public spaces, and have illicit substances rather than other prescription opioids. Overall, heroin overdose death, previously common in San Francisco, is now rare. Prescription opioid overdose has emerged as a signiﬁcant concern, particularly among individuals in high-poverty areas. Deaths in poor and afﬂuent regions involve different causative opioids and co-occurring substances.},

	abstract = {Background: Drug poisoning is the leading cause of death from injuries in the United States. In New York City (NYC), unintentional drug poisoning death is the third leading cause of premature death, and opioids are the most commonly occurring class of drugs. Opioid overdose prevention efforts aim to decrease the number of people at risk for overdose and to decrease fatality rates among those using opioids by improving overdose response. These strategies can be enhanced with a comprehensive understanding of the settings in which overdoses occur.
Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of unintentional opioid poisoning deaths in NYC from 2005 to 2010 (n = 2649). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with settings of fatal opioid overdose.
Results: Three-quarters of the sample overdosed in a home; one-tenth in an institution, and the remaining in a public indoor setting, the outdoors or another non-home setting. Factors associated with overdosing at home include female gender, college degree, residence in the borough of Staten Island, and combined use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines. Factors associated with overdosing outside of the home include ages 35–64, residence in Manhattan, and use of heroin.
Conclusion: The sample represents a near census of unintentional opioid overdose deaths in NYC during the study period, and allows for the identiﬁcation of demographic and drug-using patterns by setting of overdose. Because most opioid overdoses occur inside the home, opioid overdose response programs can most efﬁciently address the epidemic by both reducing the risk of overdose in the home and targeting those who may be in the home at the time of an overdose for overdose response training. Approaches include minimizing risk of misuse and diversion through safe storage and safe disposal programs, physician education on prescribing of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines, prescription of take-home naloxone, and Good Samaritan laws.},

	abstract = {There were over 23,000 opioid overdose deaths in the USA in 2013, and opioidrelated mortality is increasing. Increased access to naloxone, particularly through community-based lay naloxone distribution, is a widely supported strategy to reduce opioid overdose mortality; however, little is known about the ecological and spatial patterns of the distribution and utilization of lay naloxone. This study aims to investigate the neighborhoodlevel correlates and spatial relationships of lay naloxone distribution and utilization and opioid overdose deaths. We determined the locations of lay naloxone distribution sites and the number of unintentional opioid overdose deaths and reported reversal events in San Francisco census tracts (n = 195) from 2010 to 2012. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare census tract characteristics across tracts adjacent and not adjacent to distribution sites and multivariable negative binomial regression models to assess the association between census tract characteristics, including distance to the nearest site, and counts of opioid overdose deaths and naloxone reversal events. Three hundred forty-two opioid overdose deaths and 316 overdose reversals with valid location data were included in our analysis. Census tracts including or adjacent to a distribution site had higher income inequality, lower percentage black or African American residents, more drug arrests, higher population density, more overdose deaths, and more reversal events (all p G 0.05). In multivariable analysis, greater distance to the nearest distribution site (up to a distance of 4000 m) was associated with a lower count of Naloxone reversals [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.51 per 500 m increase, 95\% CI 0.39–0.67, p G 0.001] but was not signiﬁcantly associated with opioid overdose deaths. These ﬁndings afﬁrm that locating lay naloxone distribution sites in areas with high levels of substance use and overdose risk facilitates reversals of opioid overdoses in those immediate areas but suggests that alternative delivery methods may be necessary to reach individuals in other areas with less concentrated risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Prior research on prescription drug misuse has focused on identifying individual risk factors. While a few studies examine differences in misuse based on geographic residence, there is a lack of research that examines the relevance of neighbourhood characteristics.
Methods: The current research used data from the 2000 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, a sample of respondents that was generalizable to the non-institutionalised population of the United States. Logistic regression models were estimated to examine the relationship between neighbourhood characteristics (e.g., social disorganisation, social capital, and social participation) and prescription drug misuse (e.g., any misuse, pain reliever misuse, sedative/tranquiliser misuse, and stimulant misuse) among adolescent respondents ages 12–17.
Results: Findings show that neighbourhood characteristics were signiﬁcantly associated with any prescription drug misuse and also the misuse of prescription opioids. Adolescents in socially disorganised neighbourhoods and also those in neighbourhoods with lower levels of social capital were more likely to report prescription drug misuse. Interestingly, adolescents with greater levels of social participation were more likely to report prescription drug misuse.
Conclusion: These ﬁndings were largely consistent with prior research examining the signiﬁcance of neighbourhood characteristics in relation to crime and deviance. In order to adequately address the ongoing prescription drug epidemic in the United States, policy makers must address the neighbourhood characteristics that are known to be associated with prescription drug misuse.},

Since then, the finding that citizens care enormously about the process by which outcomes are reached—even unfavorable outcomes—has been replicated a wide range of methodologies (including panel surveys, psychometric work, and experimentation), cultures (throughout North America, Europe, and Asia), and settings (including tort litigation, policing, taxpayer compliance, support for public policies, and organizational citizenship). We have learned a great deal about the antecedents and consequences of these judgments. In particular, the work of Tom Tyler and Allan Lind and their colleagues suggests that people care about voice, dignity, and respect for relational and symbolic reasons rather than (or in addition to) instrumental reasons. This finding has benevolent implications for governance and social cooperation, but also some troubling implications, leaving people susceptible to manipulation and exploitation.},

Good Samaritan laws provide immunity from prosecution for drug possession to anyone who seeks medical assistance in the event of a drug overdose; NALs allow laypersons to administer naloxone, which temporarily counteracts the effects of an opioid overdose. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System multiple-cause-of-death mortality files for 1999–2014, this study is the first to examine the effects of these laws on overdose deaths involving opioids. The estimated effects of GSLs on opioid-related mortality are consistently negative but not statistically significant. Adoption of an NAL is associated with a statistically significant 9–10 percent reduction in opioid-related mortality, although the negative association between NALs and opioid-related mortality appears to be driven by early adopters—states that passed legislation before 2011.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Naloxone access laws (NALs) have been suggested to be an important strategy to reduce opioid-related harm. We describe the evolution of NALs across states and over time and review existing evidence of their overall association with naloxone distribution and opioid overdose as well as the potential effects of specific NAL components. Methods Descriptive analysis of temporal variation in US regional adoption of NAL components, accompanied by a systematic search of 13 databases for studies (published between 2005 and 20 December 2019) assessing the effects of NALs on naloxone distribution or opioid-related health outcomes. Eleven studies, all published since 2018, met inclusion criteria. Study time-frames spanned 1999–2017. Opioid-related overdose mortality, emergency department episodes and naloxone distribution were correlated with the presence of a NAL and, where data were available, NAL components. Results Existing evidence suggests mixed, but generally beneficial, effects for NALs. Nearly all studies show that NALs, particularly those that permit naloxone distribution without patient-specific prescriptions, are associated with increased naloxone access [incidence rate ratios (IRR) range from 1.40, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15–1.66 to 7.75, 95\% CI = 1.22–49.35] and increased opioid-related emergency department visits (IRR range from 1.14, 95\% CI = 1.07–1.20 to 1.15, 95\% CI = 1.02–1.29). Most studies show NALs are associated with reduced overdose mortality, although findings vary depending on the specific NAL components and time-period analyzed (IRR range from 0.66, 95\% CI = 0.42–0.90 to 1.27, 95\% CI = 1.27–1.27). Few studies account for the variation in opioid environments (i.e. illicit versus prescription) or other policy dimensions that may be correlated with outcomes. Conclusions The existing literature on naloxone access laws in the United States supports beneficial effects for increased naloxone distribution, but provides inconclusive evidence for reduced fatal opioid overdose. Mixed findings may reflect variation in the laws’ design and implementation, confounding effects of concurrent policy adoption, or differential effectiveness in light of changing opioid environments.},

A growing body of policing research has highlighted that officers commonly report working within police departments that lack procedural fairness and that these intradepartmental dynamics influence officers motivation and behavior on the street. This study builds on this work by examining the influence of a procedurally fair organizational climate on officer’s organizational behavior, commitment to democratic policing, and well-being. Patrol officers and sergeants in a large urban police force completed surveys assessing their perceptions of their department, the communities they police, their views on different policing styles, and their well-being. Results showed that when officers were in a procedurally fair department, they were more likely to trust and feel obligated to obey their supervisors, less likely to be psychologically and emotionally distressed, and less likely to be cynical and mistrustful about the world in general and the communities they police in particular. More importantly, these effects were associated with greater endorsement of democratic forms of policing, increased organizational efficiency, and officer well-being. Taken together these results clearly support the utility of infusing procedural justice into the internal working climate as a means to improve police officer job performance, their well-being, and their relationship with the communities they police.},

	abstract = {Objectives To quantify nonfatal injurious police shootings of people and examine the factors associated with victim mortality. Methods We gathered victim-level data on fatal and nonfatal injurious police shootings from four states that have such information publicly available: Florida (2009–14), Colorado (2010–19), Texas (2015–19), and California (2016–19). For each state, we examined bivariate associations between mortality and race/ethnicity, gender, age, weapon, and access to trauma care. We also estimated logistic regression models predicting victim mortality in each state. Results Forty-five percent of these police shooting victims (N = 1,322) did not die. Black–white disparities were more pronounced in nonfatal injurious police shootings than in fatal police shootings. Overall, Black victims were less likely than white victims to die from their wound(s). Younger victims were less likely to die from their wound(s), as well as those who were unarmed. Conclusions Racial and age disparities in police shootings are likely more pronounced than previous estimates suggest. Policy implications Other states should strongly consider compiling data like that which is currently being gathered in California. Absent data on nonfatal injurious police shootings–which account for a large share of deadly force incidents–researchers and analysts must be cautious about comparing and/or ranking jurisdictions in terms of their police-involved fatality rates.},

In the two years since the Floy protests began, large metropolitan agencies have experienced significant increases in resignations, retirements, or both.

	abstract = {Many U.S. cities witnessed both de-policing and increased crime in 2020, yet it remains unclear whether the former contributed to the latter. Indeed, much of what is known about the effects of proactive policing on crime comes from studies that evaluate highly focused interventions atypical of day-to-day policing, use cities as the unit of analysis, or cannot rule out endogeneity. This study addresses each of these issues, thereby advancing the evidence base concerning the effects of policing on crime. Leveraging two exogenous shocks presented by the onset of COVID19 and social unrest following the murder of George Floyd, we evaluated the effects of sudden and sustained reductions in high-discretion policing on crime at the neighborhood level in Denver. Multilevel models accounting for trends in prior police activity, neighborhood structure, seasonality, and population mobility revealed mixed results. On one hand, large-scale reductions in pedestrian stops and drug-related arrests were associated with significant increases in violent and property crimes, respectively. On the other hand, fewer vehicle stops and disorder arrests did not affect crime. These results were not universal across neighborhoods. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of debates concerning the appropriate role of policing in the 21st century.},

What is the effect of such ‘self-legitimacy’ on the way they think about policing? This article addresses these questions using a survey of police officers working in an English Constabulary. We find that the most powerful predictor of officers’ confidence in their own authority is identification with their organization, itself something strongly associated with perceptions of the procedural justice of senior management. A greater sense of self-legitimacy is in turn linked to greater commitment to democratic modes of policing. Finally, we find that this sense of legitimacy is embedded in a matrix of identities and cultural adaptations within the police organization.},

	abstract = {Several scholars have suggested that life changes—such as desistance from crime—may be shaped by social structures through a process of “knifing off.” Individuals are thought to change their lives by severing themselves from harmful environments, undesirable companions, or even the past itself. Despite the frequent use of this terminology in criminology and other fields, the concept of knifing off remains underdeveloped. Few studies have considered diverse contexts and conditions in which knifing off may or may not occur. The authors raise the following questions: What is knifing off? What gets knifed off, and who does the knifing? Is knifing off necessary and/or sufficient for behavioral change? They conclude that the concept is useful for understanding desistance and self-change but also encourage further refinement and clarification. Recommendations are proposed for developing the concept of knifing off for theories of desistance, particularly recognizing the significance of life scripts for constructing a noncriminal future.},

	abstract = {Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the need for wide deployment of effective harm reduction strategies in preventing opioid overdose mortality. Placing naloxone in the hands of key responders, including law enforcement officers who are often first on the scene of a suspected overdose, is one such strategy. New York State (NYS) was one of the first states to implement a statewide law enforcement naloxone administration program. This article provides an overview of the law enforcement administration of naloxone in NYS between 2015 and 2020 and highlights key characteristics of over 9000 opioid overdose reversal events.
Methods:  Data in naloxone usage report forms completed by police officers were compiled and analyzed. Data included 9133 naloxone administration reports by 5835 unique officers located in 60 counties across NYS. Descriptive statistics were used to examine attributes of the aided individuals, including differences between fatal and non-fatal incidents. Additional descriptive analyses were conducted for incidents in which law enforcement officers arrived first at the scene of suspected overdose. Comparisons were made to examine year-over-year trends in administration as naloxone formulations were changed. Quantitative analysis was supplemented by content analysis of officers’ notes (n = 2192).
Results:  In 85.9\% of cases, law enforcement officers arrived at the scene of a suspected overdose prior to emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. These officers assessed the likelihood of an opioid overdose having occurred based on the aided person’s breathing status and other information obtained on the scene. They administered an average of 2 doses of naloxone to aided individuals. In 36.8\% of cases, they reported additional administration of naloxone by other responders including EMS, fire departments, and laypersons. Data indicated the aided survived the suspected overdose in 87.4\% of cases.
Conclusions:  With appropriate training, law enforcement personnel were able to recognize opioid overdoses and prevent fatalities by administering naloxone and carrying out time-sensitive medical interventions. These officers provided life-saving services to aided individuals alongside other responders including EMS, fire departments, and bystanders. Further expansion of law enforcement naloxone administration nationally and internationally could help decrease opioid overdose mortality.},

We begin by constructing groups based on cumulative childhood risk and measure their subsequent criminal career outcomes. The results show clear differences in adult offending but also considerable heterogeneity, suggesting that the relationship between risk factors and individuals’ subsequent offending or non-offending is complex and in need of closer study. We therefore identify individuals in the low- and high-risk groups who did not develop the criminal careers that could be expected from their risk scores and, using deviant case analysis, qualitatively analyze their life histories. Together, these cases inform us of the importance of the dynamics of risk, human agency, and the life course, as well as the historical influences under which their lives unfolded—features of social life that could in no way be predicted prospectively.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study empirically evaluates a normative obligation to obey the police scale that was introduced by Po´sch et al. (2021) to address problems with traditional obligation measures. The objective is twofold: (1) to assess the measurement qualities of the scale, and (2) to test the scale's direct and mediating effects on theoretically-relevant variables.
Methods: Using survey data from a national opt-in online sample (N = 1509), this study employs exploratory and confirmatory factor-analytic techniques to assess the scale's underlying structure. Path analysis using maximumlikelihood estimation and bootstrapped standard errors is used to test the direct and mediating effects.
Results: The factor models indicate that the normative obligation to obey the police scale is a unique latent construct, which is distinguishable from an obligation measure rooted in coercion and dull compulsion. The results from the path model demonstrate that normative obligation to obey the police is associated with a higher willingness to cooperate with police. The indirect effects show that the normative obligation scale mediates the association between procedural justice of the police and willingness to cooperate. The direct and indirect effects do not achieve statistical significance in the path model when compliance with the law is specified as the cri­ terion variable.
Conclusions: This study highlights some of the challenges associated with operationalizing police legitimacy. Nevertheless, the evidence is encouraging and supports Po´sch et al.'s normative obligation to obey the police scale.},

The present contribution draws upon self-determination theory (SDT) to advance the procedural justice model through its focus on internalization, in terms of identification and external regulation. Study 1 is a questionnaire-based study conducted among 268 Belgian adolescents that provides initial evidence for the incremental value of the SDT-based operationalization of internalization, above and beyond the classic operationalization (i.e., obligation to obey), for explaining why perceived procedural justice is linked to more compliance and less defiance. These results are corroborated in Study 2, which involves an experimental, vignette-based study (N = 210) contrasting a procedurally just versus unjust situation. The discussion focuses on how SDT may inform the legal socialization literature.},

	abstract = {Can fatal shootings by American police be reduced? If so, what theoretical framework would be most useful in saving more lives? What research agenda would that framework suggest? The purpose of this review is to answer those three questions. It applies the system-accident framework ( Perrow 1984 ) as a pathway to help police agencies reduce fatal police shootings, adapting it as system-crash prevention to encompass a wider range of systemic causes of catastrophic events. In contrast to deterrence, the dominant policy perspective on reducing fatal shootings, a system-crash prevention approach applies lateral thinking ( Johnson 2010 ) from lessons learned about airplane crashes, surgical errors, nuclear power plant meltdowns, and other rare events in complex systems. This framework spotlights the rare combinations of risk factors and errors that can produce fatal shootings, the prevention of which may need to vary widely between large and small communities. Of the 986 fatal police shootings reported nationally in 2015 ( Wash. Post 2016 ), an estimated half occurred in cities with fewer than 50,000 residents; only a third occurred in cities over 250,000 residents ( Sherman 2015 ), where the majority of all research on police shootings has been done. The system designs for fewer police killings in very large versus very small police agencies require a general framework for policy-relevant criminology. The framework suggested by Sampson et al. (2013) requires research to identify (a) causal mechanisms that may generally help to reduce fatal police shootings but may also have (b) heterogeneous effects that may work differently on different subpopulations or when their application is (c) contextualized in different social settings. Future research must therefore include very small communities in order to understand and help prevent the majority of all fatal police shootings.},

Being legitimate is important to the success of authorities, institutions, and institutional arrangements since it is difficult to exert influence over others based solely upon the possession and use of power. Being able to gain voluntary acquiescence from most people, most of the time, due to their sense of obligation increases effectiveness during periods of scarcity, crisis, and conflict.

	abstract = {This paper provides the first empirical examination of the impact of federal and state "Pattern-orPractice" investigations on crime and policing. For investigations that were not preceded by "viral" incidents of deadly force, investigations, on average, led to a statistically significant reduction in homicides and total crime. In stark contrast, all investigations that were preceded by "viral" incidents of deadly force have led to a large and statistically significant increase in homicides and total crime. We estimate that these investigations caused almost 900 excess homicides and almost 34,000 excess felonies. The leading hypothesis for why these investigations increase homicides and total crime is an abrupt change in the quantity of policing activity. In Chicago, the number of police-civilian interactions decreased by almost 90\% in the month after the investigation was announced. In Riverside CA, interactions decreased 54\%. In St. Louis, self-initiated police activities declined by 46\%. Other theories we test such as changes in community trust or the aggressiveness of consent decrees associated with investigations -- all contradict the data in important ways.},

	abstract = {Objective Joan McCord was an experimental criminologist who advocated for evaluating social programs for efficacy, benefits, and potential harms to guide crime prevention policy. This paper argues that criminal justice reform should be guided by evidence for effective social programs that guard against unintended harms. Programs that focus on social control are consistent with basic facts of crime and guard against the tail risk of surges in serious crime and violence. This paper discusses the evidence from evaluations of social programs which are based on principals of social control in families, schools, neighborhoods, and the criminal justice system.
Methods  This paper draws upon the evaluations of social programs that have been published based on at least one high-quality experiment or two rigorous quasiexperiments, that can be scaled to entire populations, and are sustainable over time.
Results  A review of experimental and quasi-experimental evidence found that social programs focused on increasing social control (formal or informal) in families, schools, communities, and by the criminal justice system are effective at preventing serious crime. Some of the social programs with rigorous evidence of preventing crime could be scaled to entire populations for prolonged durations with adequate planning and implementation models.
Conclusion  Many contemporary criminal justice reforms have little evidence of efficacy, and run the risk of generating unintended adverse outcomes related to the spread of serious crime and violence. Existing evidence suggests that social programs that focus on social control can act as buffers against the tail risk of serious crime. The social programs with evidence of preventing crime should be expanded, monitored for fidelity in implementation, and continuously evaluated to improve their efficacy and sustainability as effective safeguards against the rise in serious crime and violence.},

	abstract = {Engaging Muslims in counter-terrorism (CT) has proved challenging for police worldwide. Some research has focussed on the utility of police being procedurally just in their CT strategies to enhance their legitimacy and subsequent cooperation from Muslims. Despite the efﬁcacy of procedural justice, however, some have argued that procedural justice scholarship is too narrowly focussed on how police treat citizens. Citizens’ concerns about police acting within the limits of appropriate power (i.e., “bounded-authority” concerns), as well as representativeness in policing (i.e., “representative bureaucracy”), can also inﬂuence citizens’ judgments of police legitimacy. This study explores how, when, and why procedural justice, bounded authority, and representation concerns shape Muslims’ perceptions of police CT measures and police legitimacy. Using focus group data from 104 Australian-Muslims, results revealed that CT measures that include Muslims as partners in terrorism prevention and those that draw on principles of procedural justice were perceived most favourably, and were seen to promote police legitimacy. Measures that were condemned were perceived as bounded-authority violations and damaged police legitimacy. Implications for theory and police practice are discussed.},

Research on legal socialization distinguishes between two different orientations toward the law: coercive and consensual. Coercive orientations are rooted in the use of force and punishment, ultimately leading to an instrumentally focused relationship built on dominance. Consensual orientations are rooted in the acquisition of values encompassing concerns over treatment, decision making, and boundaries. When authorities embody these values, they promote trust and legitimacy and foster a relationship built on shared values and the voluntary acceptance of legal authority. Despite these ﬁndings, the appropriateness of a consensual over a coercive approach is heavily contested across legal and nonlegal contexts. However, research consistently demonstrates that socializing supportive values and encouraging favorable attitudes not only motivates compliance with the law but promotes voluntary deference and willing cooperation with legal authorities.},

Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method’s assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.},

Path analyses in Study 2 reveal that the respect-justice relationship is mediated by perceptions of deservingness. Study 3, a field survey, shows that respect is more important for the procedural fairness judgments of high self-esteem individuals. Several theoretical perspectives support the argument that these variables moderate the relation between respectful treatment and procedural fairness because of their impact on deservingness judgments.

However, numerous scholars have claimed that justice judgments stem from deservingness—a theory that poses a considerable contrast to GVT . In a study of New York City Housing Court tenants, most of whom were unrepresented, we examined whether deservingness moderates the impact of perceived treatment on justice judgments such that tenants who do not believe they deserve positive treatment will view such treatment as unfair. Results indicated that, with one exception, perceived treatment exerted a direct effect on various justice judgments as predicted by GVT, but in contrast to deservingness. Tenants were overwhelmingly positive about their housing court experience despite the documented inequalities that exist for most unrepresented litigants in housing court. These findings suggest a discrepancy between tenants’ perceptions and the realities of housing court.},

Building on social schema research, we posit civilians’ perceptions of police procedural justice only partly reflect their personal and vicarious experiences with officers. We theorize perceptions of the police are anchored in a broader ‘‘relational justice schema,’’ composed of views about how respectful, fair, and unbiased most people are in their dealings with others. Individuals’ experiences with certain nonlegal actors and neighborhood environments should directly affect their relational justice schema and indirectly affect their evaluation of police. Nevertheless, experiences with police, especially mistreatment by officers, should also affect perceived police procedural justice and may moderate the effects of relational justice schema endorsement. We test our hypotheses in two studies with national samples. The findings strongly support a social schematic model of perceived police procedural justice.},

It is inevitable that some of these interactions will result in injuries to both subjects and officers, with a range of both tangible and intangible harms and costs. It is therefore important to study injuries related to the use of force with an eye toward identifying opportunities to minimize injury and reduce the harms and costs. Injuries to both subjects and officers were examined in a sample of more than 10,000 use of force incidents drawn from 81 agencies located in 8 states. In addition to describing injury rates across a broad spectrum of situational and agency characteristics, we present multilevel logistic regression models predicting subject and officer injury. Among key findings, we report that the likelihood of injury for both subjects and officers is lower when force incidents end quickly and with the minimal necessary superior level of force relative to subject resistance, and higher for both subjects and officers when subjects flee. At the agency level, we find that the likelihood of injury varies by agency size and type. Finally, we explored possible higher-level variation and found that agencies in the sample from Midwestern states (primarily Wisconsin) have substantially lower injury rates that appear to be associated with their less frequent use of weapons and greater reliance on low-level physical force tactics, as compared to agencies in the sample from Western and other states.},

Results show that physical force is most likely to be used in situations marked by lower levels of subject resistance. This explains both its frequent use and its eﬀectiveness at incapacitating resistant subjects. However, physical force is also most likely to result in oﬃcer and subject injuries, which is problematic.

This study used official data from an Australian jurisdiction to explore injuries sustained by officers in 202 police–citizen encounters involving force. The study examined situation, suspect, and officer characteristics, as well as officers’ decision-making and the force level chosen relative to the suspects’ level of resistance. Multiple regression showed the most predictive factors of officer injury were encounters with physically aggressive suspects and situations where police used lower levels of force compared to suspect resistance. Significant effects were also found for crime event and suspect-related variables.

	abstract = {In their seminal “Broken Windows” article in Atlantic Monthly, J. Q. Wilson and G. L. Kelling (1982) suggested that police could more effectively ﬁght crime by targeting minor offenses. They hypothesized that untended disorder increases fear of crime in a community, starting a chain of events that eventually leads to heightened levels of crime. By targeting disorder, police can thus circumvent this cycle of neighborhood decline (Skogan, 1990). This study aimed to improve knowledge of the relationship between disorder and fear of crime in the context of the broken windows hypothesis by using a micro-place level research design involving a police crackdown on disorder and minor crime at hot spots. The results of the current study suggest that perceived social disorder and observed levels of physical disorder have a strong impact on fear of crime. This conﬁrms the relationship between disorder and fear hypothesized by the broken windows literature, and implies that police may be able to reduce fear of crime by reducing disorder. It was also found, however, that the police intervention itself signiﬁcantly increased the probability of feeling unsafe. Accordingly, any fear reduction beneﬁts gained by reducing disorder may be offset by the fact that the policing strategies employed simultaneously increase fear of crime. These ﬁndings suggest the importance of a careful focus on “how” broken windows policing programs are implemented. Such programs must be geared not only to reduce disorder, but also to prevent increases in citizen fear that accompany crackdowns and other intensive enforcement efforts associated with broken windows policing.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research highlights the collateral consequences of mass incarceration, including stopand-frisk policing tactics. Living in a neighborhood with aggressive policing may affect one's mental health, especially for men who are the primary targets of police stops. We examine whether there is an association between psychological distress and neighborhood-level aggressive policing (i.e., frisking and use of force by police) and whether that association varies by gender. The 2009e2011 New York City (NYC) Stop, Question, and Frisk Database is aggregated to the neighborhood-level (N ¼ 34) and merged with individual data from the 2012 NYC Community Health Survey (N ¼ 8066) via the United Hospital Fund neighborhood of respondents' residence. Weighted multilevel generalized linear models are used to assess main and gendered associations of neighborhood exposures to aggressive police stops on psychological distress (Kessler-6 items). While the neighborhood stop rate exhibits inconsistent associations with psychological distress, neighborhood-level frisk and use of force proportions are linked to higher levels of non-speciﬁc psychological distress among men, but not women. Speciﬁcally, men exhibit more non-speciﬁc psychological distress and more severe feelings of nervousness, effort, and worthlessness in aggressively surveilled neighborhoods than do women. Male residents are affected by the escalation of stop-and-frisk policing in a neighborhood. Living in a context of aggressive policing is an important risk factor for men's mental health.},

It hypothesizes that procedures are important because they shape people's social identity within groups, and social identity in turn influences attitudes, values, and behaviors. The model further hypothesizes that resource judgments exercise their influence indirectly by shaping social identity. This social identity mediation hypothesis explains why people focus on procedural justice, and in particular on procedural elements related to the quality of their interpersonal treatment, because those elements carry the most social identity-relevant information.

	abstract = {Controversial police use-of-force incidents have eroded police legitimacy, and bodyworn cameras (BWCs) have received extensive attention as a key reform. I study the causal effects of BWCs on the use of force and law enforcement outcomes. Previous studies that randomized BWC deployment at the officer level within a single agency faced empirical challenges as (1) the control group officers are also indirectly affected by BWCs due to interactions with the treatment group officers (spillover), (2) there may be fundamental differences between agencies that agree to be researched and agencies that do not (site-selection bias), and (3) researchers could not directly examine agencywide variables such as crime rates and public opinion. I overcome these limitations by conducting the first nationwide study of BWCs across more than 1,000 agencies in the US. I find that BWCs lead to substantial decreases in the use of force, both against whites and minorities. Nationwide, they reduce police-involved homicides by 58\%. In contrast to previous studies on police accountability, I find no evidence of an association between police oversight through BWCs and reduction in policing efforts. By examining social media usage from Twitter, I find that BWC adoption has improved public opinion toward the police. These findings imply that BWCs can be an important tool for improving police accountability without sacrificing policing capabilities.},

	abstract = {The use of pedestrian stops, commonly known as SQFs (Stop, Question, and Frisk), has been one of the most common yet controversial proactive strategies in modern policing. In this paper, we report on a recently completed Campbell Collaboration Systematic Review that allows us to answer key policy questions about the use of SQFs in policing. Is there convincing evidence that pedestrian stops reduce crime? Are claims of negative impacts on individuals confirmed by research? And if there is evidence both of crime reductions and harmful effects, how do such costs and benefits weigh against each other? And finally, how do the impacts of pedestrian stops compare with other proactive policing strategies? Based on our review of findings, we conclude that existing scientific evidence does not support the widespread use of SQFs as a proactive policing strategy.},

Important contributions to key issues in developmental criminology are summarized, such as the different roles of mothers, fathers, and neighborhoods in the development of delinquency as well as the importance of differentiating discipline from punishment. We describe how Dr. McCord relied on philosophy, how she tackled oppositions between theory-driven and data-driven research in criminology, and how she helped young investigators learn how to learn, and we end by highlighting her contributions to the organization and development of criminology in the United States and around the world.},

This article suggests some progress can be made in predicting superior performance by considering an earlier stage in a police officer's career where performance is well-defined and measurable: the police academy. Using recruit performance data ( n = 1,556) from a large metropolitan police department, the article uses linear and logistic regression, as well as Chi-square Automatic Indicator Detector (CHIAD), to identify predictors of superior performance in the academy. A number of interesting findings emerge with regard to factors that offer predictive value—reading level, age, gender, and race—and those that do not—college education, military experience, and residency. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for recruitment, selection, and training, as well as for measuring and predicting performance on the street.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether abandoned house remediation reduces gun violence and substance-related outcomes and increases perceptions of safety and use of outdoor space. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cluster randomized trial was conducted from January 2017 to August 2020, with interventions occurring between August 2018 and March 2019. The study included abandoned houses across Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and surveys completed by participants living nearby preintervention and postintervention. Data analysis was performed from March 2021 to September 2022. INTERVENTIONS The study consisted of 3 arms: (1) full remediation (installing working windows and doors, cleaning trash, weeding); (2) trash cleanup and weeding only; and (3) a no-intervention control. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Difference-in-differences mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate the effect of the interventions on multiple primary outcomes: gun violence (weapons violations, gun assaults, and shootings), illegal substance trafficking and use, public drunkenness, and perceptions of safety and time outside for nearby residents.
RESULTS A master list of 3265 abandoned houses was randomly sorted. From the top of this randomly sorted list, a total of 63 clusters containing 258 abandoned houses were formed and then randomly allocated to 3 study arms. Of the 301 participants interviewed during the preintervention period, 172 (57.1\%) were interviewed during the postintervention period and were included in this analysis; participants were predominantly Black, and most were employed. Study neighborhoods were predominantly Black with high percentages of low-income households. Gun violence outcomes increased in all study arms, but increased the least in the full remediation arm. The full housing remediation arm, compared with the control condition, showed reduced weapons violations by −8.43\% (95\% CI, −14.68\% to −1.19\%), reduced gun assaults by −13.12\% (95\% CI, −21.32\% to −3.01\%), and reduced shootings by a nonsignificant −6.96\% (95\% CI, −15.32\% to 3.03\%). The trash cleanup arm was not associated with a significant differential change in any gun violence outcome. Instances of illegal substance trafficking and use and public drunkenness outcomes were not significantly affected by the housing remediation or trash cleanup treatment. Perceptions of neighborhood safety and time spent outside were unaffected by the intervention. The study arms did differ in a baseline characteristic and some preintervention trends, which raises questions regarding other potential nonmeasured differences between study arms that could have influenced estimates. No evidence of displacement of gun violence outcomes was found.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cluster randomized controlled trial among low-income, predominantly Black neighborhoods, inexpensive, straightforward abandoned housing remediation was directly linked to significant relative reductions in weapons violations and gun assaults, and suggestive reductions in shootings.},

	abstract = {The murder of George Floyd triggered a broad social response and noticeable shift in public opinion of policing. Since policing is dependent upon public cooperation, a question is whether the shift in opinion had an effect on police calls-for-service. Data from Los Angeles and New York City are evaluated using a regression discontinuity design. Violent crime, property crime, and quality-of-life disorder calls are analyzed to address differences in reporting norms. The role of racial–ethnic composition of local areas is assessed by examining census tracts where the majority of the residential population is Asian, Black, Hispanic, or White. Following the murder of George Floyd, in New York City violent crime, property crime, and quality-of-life calls all increased significantly. In Los Angeles, quality-of-life calls for service decreased significantly. The increase in violent crime calls observed in New York was greatest in areas where the majority of residents are Black, whereas the increase in property crime calls was the greatest in areas where a majority of residents are White. The decrease in quality-of-life calls observed in Los Angeles was in areas where the majority of residents are White. In both cases, the effect was relatively short-lived.},

Models incorporating age and variables derived from these two theories are tested with data on adolescent substance use among a large sample of Midwest adolescents in Grades 7 through 12. Older adolescents consume more marijuana than younger adolescents, and the age-use curve is matched by the relationship between age and social learning variables. Differences in use by age are also correlated with differences in strength of social bonds by age, but to a lesser extent. The findings support the hypothesis that age variations in marijuana use are mediated by age-related variations in social learning; there is also support, although somewhat weaker, for the similar hypothesis that social bonding variables mediate the age-marijuana use relationship during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Over the past several months, the coronavirus has infected more than six million Americans and killed nearly 200,000. Governors have issued stay-at-home orders, and prosecutors have filed criminal charges against individuals for defying those orders. And yet many Americans have still refused to keep their distance from their fellow citizens, even if they had symptoms of infection. The authors explore the underlying causes for those who intend to defy these norms.
Methods: Using national-level data from a March 2020 survey of 989 Americans, the authors explore intentions to defy social distancing norms by testing an interactionist theory of foundation-based moral behavior in combination with faith in President Trump during the coronavirus pandemic. The analysis controls for a range of variables, including measures of low self-control and deterrence.
Results: Low self-control is the strongest predictor of defiance intentions. Consistent with interactionist theory, defiance intentions are significantly higher for those holding specific faith in Trump and those endorsing binding foundations. Furthermore, the interaction of these two variables is significant and in the predicted direction. The results hold for two different measures of faith in Trump.
Conclusions: Even with a strong effect for low self-control, faith in President Trump is a strong predictor of refusal to social-distance, and its effect is largest among individuals high in binding foundations.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              The U.S. prison population has fallen 15\% overall, 28\% for Blacks, and 21\% for Hispanics since the Great Recession began. These trends occurred despite rising defendant criminal histories and the continued presence of the punitive policies that drove “mass incarceration.” We test the central hypothesis that court actors employed several discretionary tools available under Florida's sentencing system to reduce prison use, which in turn reduced direct and indirect racial disparities.
            
            
              Methods
              To test this hypothesis, we utilized 20 years of felony cases. Our analyses employ current best practices for testing interactive effects and decomposition models to identify changes in prison use and the factors associated with these changes.
            
            
              Results
              We find criminal history scores rose sharply, but prison use and racial disparities therein fell markedly in the past decade. The key factors driving these trends are reductions in the influence of criminal history on decision-making, increased use of mitigated departures, and the flexibility of Florida's sentencing system to accommodate mitigated departures. In fact, if Florida's sentencing rules had been followed more closely, racial disparities in prison sentences would have grown.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This research has implications for reforms aimed at ending mass incarceration and reducing racial disparities in imprisonment.},

Yet, there is no empirical research that compares case outcomes between jurisdictions headed by progressive and traditional chief prosecutors. In this research, we utilize a cumulative case outcome approach that tracks cases from arrest to disposition to examine whether cases prosecuted under progressive chief prosecutors receive less punitive sanctions and exhibit smaller racial/ethnic disparities. We find that cases adjudicated in progressive jurisdictions are more likely to end without a felony conviction and less likely to result in a prison sentence. Racial but not generally ethnic disadvantage is evident in case outcomes, and racial disparities are smaller in jurisdictions led by progressive chief prosecutors.},

	abstract = {Objectives An important indicator of discrimination in the criminal justice system is the degree to which race differences in arrest account for racial disproportionality in prisons (‘‘accountability’’). A recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study raised concerns by reporting low and declining estimates of accountability. Our improved measure accounts for unreported Hispanic arrestees. We measure accountability at intermediate stages, including commitments to prison and time served. We also use victim reports to extend accountability from arrest to differential involvement in violent crimes.
Methods Our methods utilize information on self-reported racial identity of Hispanic prisoners to provide more accurate comparison with the race of arrestees. We also assess accountability for 42 individual states and 4 regions.
Results Our national estimate of accountability is close to previous estimates and much higher than those in the NAS report. Accountability is high for the serious violent crimes of murder and rape, and low for drug trafﬁcking, drug possession, weapons, and aggravated assault, which involve more discretion in arrest, labeling and charging.
Conclusions Our more accurate accountability results contradict the NAS report of low and declining accountability. Regional accountability estimates show no consistently stronger or weaker region. We also show a corrected national estimate of the ratio of blackto-white incarceration-rates has dropped from 6.8 in 1990 to 4.7 in 2011, an important correction to concerns of increasing discrimination. Reports of offenders’ race by victims and arrestees’ race are found to be close, supporting use of arrest as an indicator of involvement in violent crimes.},

	abstract = {Background Illicit drug overdose remains a leading cause of premature mortality in urban settings worldwide. We sought to estimate the number of deaths potentially averted by the implementation of a medically supervised safer injection facility (SIF) in Vancouver, Canada. Methodology/Principal Findings The number of potentially averted deaths was calculated using an estimate of the local ratio of non-fatal to fatal overdoses. Inputs were derived from counts of overdose deaths by the British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency and non-fatal overdose rates from published estimates. Potentially-fatal overdoses were defined as events within the SIF that required the provision of naloxone, a 911 call or an ambulance. Point estimates and 95\% Confidence Intervals (95\% CI) were calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Between March 1, 2004 and July 1, 2008 there were 1004 overdose events in the SIF of which 453 events matched our definition of potentially fatal. In 2004, 2005 and 2006 there were 32, 37 and 38 drug-induced deaths in the SIF's neighbourhood. Owing to the wide range of non-fatal overdose rates reported in the literature (between 5\% and 30\% per year) we performed sensitivity analyses using non-fatal overdose rates of 50, 200 and 300 per 1,000 person years. Using these model inputs, the number of averted deaths were, respectively: 50.9 (95\% CI: 23.6–78.1); 12.6 (95\% CI: 9.6–15.7); 8.4 (95\% CI: 6.5–10.4) during the study period, equal to 1.9 to 11.7 averted deaths per annum. Conclusions/Significance Based on a conservative estimate of the local ratio of non-fatal to fatal overdoses, the potentially fatal overdoses in the SIF during the study period could have resulted in between 8 and 51 deaths had they occurred outside the facility, or from 6\% to 37\% of the total overdose mortality burden in the neighborhood during the study period. These data should inform the ongoing debates over the future of the pilot project.},

	abstract = {Background The opioid epidemic has led to an increase in the number of persons who inject drugs, and this population accounts for 12\% of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 60\% of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in the United States annually. While persons who inject drugs disproportionately utilize the emergency department (ED), accurate data is lacking on the prevalence and patterns of injection drug use, and prevalence of co-occurring HIV and HCV infections among ED patients. Objective The primary outcome was to assess the prevalence of injection drug use and co-occurring HIV and HCV infection among patients presenting to an urban ED. Methods This was a cross sectional study conducted at an urban ED, with an annual census of 65,000 visits. A closed-response questionnaire was developed based on publicly available validated surveys to assess patterns of injection drug use and HIV and HCV infection status, and administered by trained research assistants to all registered adult patients during 4-hour blocks of time. Results Of the 2,319 eligible patients, 2,200 (94.9\%) consented and completed the survey. 241 (11.0\%) had ever used injection drugs, 103 (4.7\%) currently used injection drugs, and 138 (6.3\%) formerly used injection drugs. White patients age 25 to 34 years and white patients age 55 to 64 years had the highest prevalence of current (25.6\%) and former (27.1\%) injection drug use, respectively. Persons who use injection drugs had a higher prevalence of HCV infection (52.7\% vs. 3.4\%) and HIV infection (6.2\% vs. 1.8\%) than the rest of the population. Conclusion A high prevalence of ED patients report injection drug use, and this population self-reports a high prevalence of HIV and HCV infection. Emergency departments are in a unique position to engage with this population with regards to substance use treatment and linkage to care for HIV and HCV infection.},

	abstract = {Background
Vancouver, Canada has a pilot supervised injecting facility (SIF), where individuals can inject pre-obtained drugs under the supervision of medical staff. There has been concern that the program may facilitate ongoing drug use and delay entry into addiction treatment.
Methods
We used Cox regression to examine factors associated with the time to the cessation of injecting, for a minimum of 6 months, among a random sample of individuals recruited from within the Vancouver SIF. In further analyses, we evaluated the time to enrolment in addiction treatment.
Results
Between December 2003 and June 2006, 1090 participants were recruited. In Cox regression, factors independently associated with drug use cessation included use of methadone maintenance therapy (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [AHR]=1.57 [95\% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.02–2.40]) and other addiction treatment (AHR=1.85 [95\% CI: 1.06–3.24]). In subsequent analyses, factors independently associated with the initiation of addiction treatment included: regular SIF use at baseline (AHR=1.33 [95\% CI: 1.04–1.72]); having contact with the addiction counselor within the SIF (AHR=1.54 [95\% CI: 1.13–2.08]); and Aboriginal ancestry (AHR=0.66 [95\% CI: 0.47–0.92]).
Conclusions
While the role of addiction treatment in promoting injection cessation has been well described, these data indicate a potential role of SIF in promoting increased uptake of addiction treatment and subsequent injection cessation. The finding that Aboriginal persons were less likely to enroll in addiction treatment is consistent with prior reports and demonstrates the need for novel and culturally appropriate drug treatment approaches for this population.},

This paper uses a newly constructed administrative dataset to estimate the effects of recent SEP openings on HIV diagnoses and drug-related deaths. I ﬁnd that SEP openings decrease HIV rates by up to 18.2 percent. However, I present new evidence that SEPs increase rates of opioid-related mortality. Effects are largest in rural counties and in counties that adopted SEPs after the inﬂux of fentanyl to the US, suggesting that needle exchanges may be less effective during periods when illicit opioids are widely available, especially in areas with high barriers to substance abuse treatment.},

We synthesize the recent generation (1994 to 2014) of immigrationcrime research focused on macrosocial (i.e., geospatial) units using a twopronged approach that combines the qualitative method of narrative review with the quantitative strategy of systematic meta-analysis. After brieﬂy reviewing contradictory theoretical arguments that scholars have invoked in efforts to explain the immigration-crime relationship, we present ﬁndings from our analysis, which (a) determined the average effect of immigration on crime rates across the body of literature and (b) assessed how variations in key aspects of research design have impacted results obtained in prior studies. Findings indicate that, overall, the immigration-crime association is negative—but very weak. At the same time, there is signiﬁcant variation in ﬁndings across studies. Study design features, including measurement of the dependent variable, units of analysis, temporal design, and locational context, impact the immigration-crime association in varied ways. We conclude the review with a discussion of promising new directions and remaining challenges in research on the immigration-crime nexus.},

Prior studies using the data in AngloAmerican courts have suggested that many legal and extralegal factors influence the decision of a guilty plea versus trial. China developed its own plea-bargaining system in 2016. Using 6826 DUI cases adjudicated in six cities, this study examines what factors affect the decision of a guilty plea and whether the guilty plea brings true benefits in Chinese courts. The results show that more serious crimes and more dangerous defendants were less likely to be disposed of through guilty pleas (as opposed to going to trial). One possible explanation is that prosecutors may make more punitive offers in these cases, which in turn discourages defendants from accepting them. In addition, using a propensity score weighting technique to control for potential confounding variables, this study finds that defendants who pleaded guilty were more likely to receive favorable case outcomes regarding pretrial detention and probation decision, which supports the argument that a guilty plea could help a defendant to avoid the “trial penalty” in Chinese criminal justice system.},

Methods: Our search identiﬁed 154 independent evaluations: 92 evaluations of adult drug courts, 34 of juvenile drug courts, and 28 of DWI drug courts. The ﬁndings of these studies were synthesized using metaanalysis.
Results: The vast majority of adult drug court evaluations, even the most rigorous evaluations, ﬁnd that participants have lower recidivism than non-participants. The average effect of participation is analogous to a drop in recidivism from 50\% to 38\%; and, these effects last up to three years. Evaluations of DWI drug courts ﬁnd effects similar in magnitude to those of adult drug courts, but the most rigorous evaluations do not uniformly ﬁnd reductions in recidivism. Juvenile drug courts have substantially smaller effects on recidivism. Larger reductions in recidivism were found in adult drug courts that had high graduation rates, and those that accepted only non-violent offenders.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings support the effectiveness of adult drug courts in reducing recidivism. The evidence assessing DWI courts' effectiveness is very promising but more experimental evaluations are needed. Juvenile drug courts typically produce small reductions in recidivism.},

	abstract = {Drug-involved offenders have been long overrepresented in prisons. Intensiﬁed drug law enforcement in many countries increased both incarceration rates, especially for drug offenses, and numbers of drug-involved prisoners. This is attributable to four features of drugs and drug markets. Drug use disorders typically are not the only problems facing drug-involved prisoners. A high proportion exhibit severe mental health problems such as major depression, personality disorders, and psychotic disorders. Before incarceration, many drug-involved prisoners have unstable housing and are at high risk of homelessness; incarceration increases that risk. The high concentration of drug-involved offenders in prisons presents numerous challenges. After release, the most obvious are high rates of drug relapse and recidivism. Former prisoners have extraordinarily high risks of drug overdoses shortly after release; in the long term, diseases acquired during imprisonment are transmitted in the community. Effective prison-based drug treatment holds promise to break this cycle and mitigate physical and mental health problems of drug-involved prisoners. Unfortunately, access to treatment modalities proven to be effective in reducing drug use and recidivism is limited. A paradigm shift in drug enforcement and treatment is needed to meet the challenges presented by individuals with drug use disorders more effectively.},

Executive Summary/Abstract BACKGROUND Drug abusers are generally more involved in crime, in particular property crime, than people who are not drug abusers. Substitution programs have been developed in order to improve drug users’ quality of life and to decrease their criminal involvement. Several evaluations, but not all, have reported crime reductions following substitution therapies based on heroin and methadone prescription. OBJECTIVES This systematic review is aimed at gaining an overall picture on the respective effects of prescription of methadone vs. heroin and other substances. Search strategy: Six databases (Medline, Campbell Crime and Justice Group, National Criminal Justice Reference Service, National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse, JSTOR and Criminal Justice Abstracts) as well as relevant journals and websites (Harm reduction Journal, Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, Drug and Alcohol Dependence, Drug and Alcohol Review, Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin, International Journal of Drug Policy, Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, Déviance et Société, Criminal Justice and Behavior, Criminologie, www.heroinstudie.de and www.drugscope.org.uk) have been searched for relevant studies meeting the inclusion criteria. SELECTION CRITERIA To be eligible, studies had to assess the effects of any substitution therapy (using e.g. methadone and/or opiates as substitution drugs). Only effects on offending have been considered. Comparisons of competing treatments (substitution therapy vs. any other form of treatment, including placebo treatment or no treatment at all) were restricted to studies meeting level 4 or higher on the scale developed by Sherman et al. (1997). In addition, one-group pre-post evaluations of substitution therapies were included because changes in offending are substantial compared to pre-treatment levels, while comparisons of treatment with several substances often show modest differences. Finally, studies that assessed the impact of drug substitution at the macro (i.e. city or regional) level were also included. The three different types of studies have been analyzed separately. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS 66 studies were considered, and 46 were selected for inclusion in the review. They separately assess the impact of methadone, buprenorphine, heroin, naltrexone, dihydrocodeine or Levo-alpha-acetylmethadone substitution on the criminal behaviour of opiates addicts. Meta-analytic techniques were used to identify overall effects of several substances. Comparisons of different treatments (i.e. substitution vs. any other treatment) were restricted to studies meeting levels 4 or 5 on the scale developed by Sherman et al. (1997). MAIN RESULTS Heroin maintenance reduces crime significantly more than Methadone maintenance. Methadone maintenance reduces offending more than treatments without substitution therapy, but the mean effect size is not significant (p {\textgreater}.1). However, very large (and significant) reductions in criminal behaviour are observed during methadone maintenance therapy with respect to pre-treatment levels. Buprenorphine does not significantly reduce criminal behaviour, although effects are positive, be it with respect to methadone or a placebo. Naltrexone treatment reduces criminality significantly more than behaviour therapy or counselling. CONCLUSION Heroin maintenance has been found to significantly reduce criminal involvement among treated subjects, and it is more effective in crime reduction than methadone maintenance. Methadone maintenance greatly reduces criminal involvement, but apparently not significantly more so than other interventions. Buprenorphine and Naltrexone have been found to be promising, although few studies have been identified using these substances in maintenance treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: Health and social impacts of safe consumption sites (SCS) are well described in multiple countries. One argument used by those opposed to SCS in the US is that findings from other countries are not relevant to the US context. We examined whether an unsanctioned SCS operating in the US affected local crime rates.
Methods: Controlled interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of police incident reports for five years before and five years after SCS opening, comparing one intervention and two control areas in one city.
Results: Narcotic/drug incidents declined across the pre- and post-intervention periods in the intervention area and remained constant in both control areas, preventing an ITS analysis but suggesting no negative impact. On average, incident reports relating to assault, burglary, larceny theft, and robbery in the post-intervention period steadily decreased at a similar rate within both the Intervention area and Control area 1. However the change in rate of decline post-intervention was statistically significantly greater in the Intervention area compared to Control area 1 (difference in slope -0.007 SDs, 95 \% CI: − 0.013, − 0.002; p = 0.01). The Intervention area had a statistically significant decline in crime over the post-intervention period compared to Control area 2 (difference in slope − 0.023 SDs, 95 \% CI: − 0.03, − 0.01; p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: Documented criminal activity decreased rather than increased in the area around an unsanctioned SCS located in the US in the five years following SCS opening.},

A literature search of approximately 37,000 titles revealed 15 sound evaluations from six countries, containing 3953 participants. There were significant positive overall effects of treatment on crime (d=0.47) and illicit drug use (d=0.38). Most evaluations originated from the UK and evaluated primarily substitution therapy-based treatment. Evaluations of other interventions were a minority. Our findings support the use of treatment programmes among substance-abusing offenders. However, these results are limited to a small set of programmes from very few countries. Therefore, sound evaluations on a range of treatments across Europe are needed.},

	abstract = {How should sentencing disparity be assessed when decisions are constrained under a sentencing guidelines system? Much of the debate over the measurement of sentence disparity under a guidelines system has focused primarily on using speciﬁc values from within the sentencing grid (e.g., minimum recommended sentence) or on using interaction terms in regression models to capture the non-additive effects of offense severity and prior record on length of sentence. In this paper, I propose an alternative method for assessing sentencing disparity that uses quantile regression models. These models offer several advantages over traditional OLS analyses (and related linear models) of sentence length, by allowing for an examination of the effects of case and offender characteristics across the full distribution of sentence lengths for a given sample of offenders. The analysis of the distribution of sentence lengths with quantile regression models allows for an examination of questions such as: Do offender characteristics, such as race or offense severity, have the same effect on sentence length for the 10\% of offenders who receive the shortest sentences as they do for the 10\% of offenders who receive the longest sentences? I illustrate the application and interpretation of these models using 1998 sentencing data from Pennsylvania. Key ﬁndings show that the effects of case and offender characteristics are variable across the distribution of sentence lengths, meaning that traditional linear models assuming a constant effect fail to capture important differences in how case and offender characteristics affect punishment decisions. I discuss the implications of these ﬁndings for understanding sentencing disparitites, as well as other possible applications of quantile regression models in the study of crime and the criminal justice system.},

This paper investigates the relationship between drug use and criminal behavior by conducting a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of the strength of the relationship. Results of a review of 30 studies showed that the odds of offending were three to four times greater for drug users than non-drug users. The odds of offending were highest among crack users and lowest among recreational drug users. This relationship held true across a range of offence types, including robbery, burglary, prostitution and shoplifting. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the study for research on the drugs crime connection and for government policy. 1 © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper provides a systematic review of the current state of knowledge about the effect of race on the decision to waive a juvenile defendant to criminal court.
Methods: Following comprehensive search strategies a total of 20 independent studies were identiﬁed that met the review's inclusion criteria, eighteen of which could be included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was used to generate weighted mean effect sizes of the effect of race on the waiver decision. Moderator analyses were also performed to explore heterogeneity.
Results: The average effect of race in the included studies was positive but not statistically signiﬁcant. Analysis also revealed substantial heterogeneity among the studies. Moderator analyses revealed that within several of the subgroups of studies, race was signiﬁcantly associated with waiver decisions.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest a nuanced and exceedingly complicated story about the role of race in waiver decisions. Most directly, the positive but nonsigniﬁcant average effect of race should raise doubts that race impacts waiver decisions in a direct fashion. However, simple claims that race does not matter are also not supported by existing knowledge. The nature of the review facilitates the development of speciﬁc recommendations for future research.},

These changes diminish the jurisdiction of juvenile courts as judicial decisions and statutory changes transfer more youths from juvenile courts to criminal courts so that young offenders can be sentenced as adults. Amendments to juvenile sentencing laws increase the punitiveness of sanctions available to juvenile court judges. Other strategies attempt to "blend," or merge, juvenile and criminal court jurisdiction and sentencing authority over violent young offenders. These "get tough" policies affect the numbers and types of youths confined in adult and juvenile correctional facilities and pose fundamental problems for administrators in both systems; accelerate procedural, jurisprudential, and substantive convergence between the juvenile and criminal justice systems; and erode the rationale for a separate juvenile court.},

	abstract = {Background: Automated geocoding of patient addresses for the purpose of conducting spatial epidemiologic studies results in positional errors. It is well documented that errors tend to be larger in rural areas than in cities, but possible effects of local characteristics of the street network, such as street intersection density and street length, on errors have not yet been documented. Our study quantifies effects of these local street network characteristics on the means and the entire probability distributions of positional errors, using regression methods and tolerance intervals/regions, for more than 6000 geocoded patient addresses from an Iowa county.
Results: Positional errors were determined for 6376 addresses in Carroll County, Iowa, as the vector difference between each 100\%-matched automated geocode and its ground-truthed location. Mean positional error magnitude was inversely related to proximate street intersection density. This effect was statistically significant for both rural and municipal addresses, but more so for the former. Also, the effect of street segment length on geocoding accuracy was statistically significant for municipal, but not rural, addresses; for municipal addresses mean error magnitude increased with length.
Conclusion: Local street network characteristics may have statistically significant effects on geocoding accuracy in some places, but not others. Even in those locales where their effects are statistically significant, street network characteristics may explain a relatively small portion of the variability among geocoding errors. It appears that additional factors besides rurality and local street network characteristics affect accuracy in general.},

            Researchers have documented the power of legal officials to administer sanctions, from arrest to court surveillance and incarceration. How do those subject to punishment interact with officials and attempt to subvert their power? Drawing on interviews and ethnographic observations among 63 criminal defendants and 42 legal officials in the Boston-area court system, this article considers how socioeconomically and racially disadvantaged defendants interact with their defense attorneys, and with what consequences. Given racialized and classed constraints, many disadvantaged defendants mistrust their court-appointed lawyers. Their mistrust often results in withdrawal from their lawyers and active efforts to cultivate their own legal knowledge and skills. Defendants use their lay legal expertise to work around and resist the authority of their lawyers. Defense attorneys and judges respond with silencing and coercion, given the unwritten norms and rules of the court. These findings complicate existing accounts of disadvantaged defendants as passive actors and contribute to cultural sociological and relational theories of how people engage with professionals across institutional spaces. Unlike in mainstream institutions such as schools and hospitals where self-advocacy is rewarded in interactions, criminal court officials reject disadvantaged defendants’ attempts to advocate for themselves.},

	abstract = {Objectives. To investigate what transpires at opioid overdoses where police administer naloxone and to identify the frequency with which concerns about police-administered naloxone are observed.
Methods. We reviewed body-worn camera (BWC) footage of all incidents where a Tempe, Arizona police ofﬁcer administered naloxone or was present when the Tempe Fire Medical Rescue (TFMR) administered it, from February 3, 2020 to May 7, 2021 (n 5 168). We devised a detailed coding instrument and employed univariate and bivariate analysis to examine the frequency of concerns regarding police-administered naloxone.
Results. Police arrived on scene before the TFMR in 73.7\% of cases. In 88.6\% of calls the individual was unconscious when police arrived, but 94.6\% survived the overdose. The primary concerns about police-administered naloxone were rarely observed. There were no cases of improper naloxone administration or accidental opioid exposure to an ofﬁcer. Aggression toward police from an overdose survivor rarely occurred (3.6\%), and arrests of survivors (3.6\%) and others on scene (1.2\%) were infrequent.
Conclusions. BWC footage provides a unique window into opioid overdoses. In Tempe, the concerns over police-administered naloxone are overstated. If results are similar elsewhere, those concerns are barriers that must be removed. (Am J Public Health.

	abstract = {Background: Opioid use has emerged as a significant public health crisis in cities across the United States. In Arizona, opioid overdose deaths increased by 65\% from 2016 to 2018, leading the Governor of Arizona to declare a State of Emergency. Because police are often the first to arrive at the scene of an overdose, officers are central to an effective response to the opioid crisis in Arizona and elsewhere. However, many police officers do not carry naloxone, which can immediately reverse the life-threatening effects of an opioid overdose. Few studies examine officer perceptions of opioid use or their willingness to carry and administer naloxone. The degree to which officers accept this public health responsibility remains unclear.
Methods: The authors administered two waves of a survey to patrol officers in the Tempe (AZ) Police Department. The officers completed wave 1 approximately three months before the start of a program that trained and outfitted patrol officers with naloxone. Officers completed wave 2 of the survey several months after the program started. Relying on the Opioid Overdose Knowledge (OOKS), Competence, Concerns, and Attitudes (OOAS) of People who Overdose, and Naloxone-Related Risk Compensation Beliefs (NaRRC-B) scales, the survey captures officer attitudes regarding opioid use, willingness to carry and administer naloxone, and perceptions of their role in responding to the opioid crisis.
Results: At wave 1, officers conveyed moderate levels of confidence in recognizing an overdose and providing lifesaving care. Officers indicated strong support for carrying naloxone and responding to opioid overdoses, and they recognized the value of treatment for users. At wave 2, officers reported significantly greater confidence and competence in responding to overdoses, and their support for carrying naloxone also increased. Both before and after program start, there was little variation in attitudes across gender, race/ethnicity, education, and length of service.
Conclusion: Officers accept this public health responsibility as part of their mission. Given that officers are frequently first on scene at overdoses and a matter of seconds can determine life or death, police-led naloxone programs will save lives in Tempe and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {The opioid crisis is the most persistent, long-term public health emergency facing the United States, and available evidence suggests the crisis has worsened during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Naloxone is an effective overdose response that saves lives, but the drug does not address problematic drug use, addiction, or the underlying conditions that lead to overdoses. The opioid crisis is at its core a multidisciplinary, multisystem problem, and an effective response to the crisis requires collaboration across those various systems. This paper describes such a collaborative effort. The Tempe First-Responder Opioid Recovery Project is a multidisciplinary partnership that includes police officers, social workers, substance use peer counselors, public health professionals, police researchers, and drug policy/harm reduction researchers. The project, 10 months underway, trained and equipped Tempe (AZ) police officers to administer Narcan. In addition, a 24/7 in-person “Crisis Outreach Response Team” rapidly responds to any suspected overdose and offers follow-up support, referrals, and services to the individual (and loved ones) for up to 45 days after the overdose. We present preliminary project data including interviews with project managers, counselors, and police officers, descriptions of Narcan administrations in the field, and aggregate data on client service engagement. These data highlight the complexity of the opioid crisis, the collaborative nature of the Tempe project, and the importance of initiating a multidisciplinary, comprehensive response to effectively deal with the opioid problem.},

This paper seeks to fill some of these knowledge gaps. Between January and May 2006, 75 current injectors were recruited and interviewed through three needle exchange programmes located in diverse geographical areas of West Yorkshire. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Framework. Findings showed that injectors were often positive about the help they received from generic health and social care services. Nonetheless, they identified a range of barriers relating to inability to access desired assistance, the burden of appointments, travel to services, stigma and negative staff attitudes, personal ill-health, lack of material resources, and anxieties about accessing support. Although some types of barriers were more evident at some services than at others and/or affected particular subgroups of injector more than others, the impact of any barrier was contingent on a range of factors. These included the attitudes of individual professionals, the circumstances and needs of individual injectors, the local availability of suitable alternative services, and the frequency with which a service needed to be accessed. In order to better understand and potentially reduce service barriers, findings are linked to broader conceptual and theoretical debates relating to social exclusion and Foucault's analyses of power and knowledge.},

Data were collected for 63 male and 175 female patients who attended the LPC over a three-year period. Patients were mostly single females, aged up to 44 years, poorly educated, unemployed or on a pension/benefit. The majority of patients reported at least one suicide attempt, severe depression and anxiety scores, moderate-severe feelings of hopelessness, and high impulsiveness scores. Compared to females, male patients presented with more active desire to kill themselves and higher level of suicidal ideation. We can conclude that establishing a specialist service for treatment of individuals at increased risk for suicide requires consideration of both patient and clinicians needs. The LPC presents an innovative model of community service, capable of engaging patients with serious mental health issues, while making the service accessible to people from various social categories.},

	abstract = {Objective: The study aimed to explore the association between area-based coverage of community services and the incidence of self-harm, which will provide an evaluation framework for the support of self-harm.
Methods: Enhanced two-Step ﬂoating catchment area method was used to estimate the centersto- population ratio and geographical accessibility adjusted by a distance-decay function. Spearman’s rank coefﬁcient was used to examine the association between the self-harm rate and adjusted accessibility index.
Results: There was a signiﬁcant negative correlation between the accessibility index and selfharm rate in youth (rho = −0.87, P {\textless} 0.01) and older adults (rho = −0.87, P {\textless} 0.01). The survival curves showed no relationship between self-harm repetition and service accessibility in youth or older adults.
Conclusions: The uneven spatial accessibility of community social service centers and the independence between spatial accessibility and self-harm highlights the need to explore personal barriers to community service utilization.},

First, this study provides the first spatial concentration estimation of opioid-related deaths. Second, our findings support the spatial concentration of opioid deaths and the feasibility of this approach for public health incidents often outside the purview of traditional policing. Third, we find that opioid overdose death hot spots spatially overlap with areas of concentrated violence. Finally, we apply a recent method, corrected Gini coefficient, to best specify low-N incident concentrations and propose a novel method for improving upon a shortcoming of this approach.

Specifically, the authors use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention restricted-access mortality data, combined with measures of community social, economic, legal, and health indicators for the period from 2000 to 2015. Findings from time-series models reveal that county concentrations of overdose are linked to multiple theoretically driven factors?including opioid prescription rates, population decline, county health problems, and manufacturing employment?with several key similarities in the determinants of death across overdose, homicide, and suicide.},

With a state-level panel containing violent and property offenses from 1970 through 2015, we employ a synthetic control group design to approximate California's crime rates had Prop 47 not been enacted. Our findings suggest that Prop 47 had no effect on homicide, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, or burglary. Larceny and motor vehicle thefts, however, seem to have increased moderately after Prop 47, but these results were both sensitive to alternative specifications of our synthetic control group and small enough that placebo testing cannot rule out spuriousness. Policy Implications As the United States engages in renewed debates regarding the scale and cost of its incarcerated population, California stands at the forefront of criminal justice reform. Although California reduced its prison population by 13,000 through Prop 47, critics argue anecdotally that the measure is responsible for recent crime upticks across the state. We find little empirical support for these claims. Thus, our findings suggest that California can downsize its prisons and jails without compromising public safety.},

	abstract = {Use of probation and parole has declined since its peak in 2007 but still intrudes into the lives of 3.9 million Americans at a scale deemed mass supervision. Originally intended as an alternative to incarceration and a means of rehabilitation for those who have committed crimes, supervision often functions as a trip wire for further criminal legal system contact. This review questions the utility of supervision, as research shows that, in toto, it currently provides neither diversion from incarceration nor rehabilitation. Analysis of national supervision, crime, and carceral data since 1980 reveals that supervision has little effect on future crime and is not a replacement for incarceration. Case studies from California and New York City indicate that concerted efforts to reduce the scope of mass supervision can effectively be achieved through sentencing reform, case diversion, and supervisory/ legal system department policy change, among other factors, without increasing crime. Therefore, we suggest extensive downsizing of supervision or experimentation with its abolition and offer actionable steps to enact each possibility.},

I first trace the genealogy of the “focal concerns” concept and detail its current articulation. I then describe the body of work that has reduced “focal concerns” to a commonsense psychological construct, and illustrate the fallacies of logic and paucity of direct theory development and testing that weaken the explanatory value of the framework.

This review examines the available evidence on how the experience of incarceration is likely to impact the probability that formerly incarcerated individuals will reoffend. Our focus is on two types of studies, those based on the random assignments of cases to judges, called judge instrumental-variable studies, and those based on discontinuities in sentence severity in sentencing grids, called regression discontinuity studies. Both types of studies are designed to account for selection bias in nonexperimental estimates of the impact of incarceration on reoffending. Most such studies find that the experience of postconviction imprisonment has little impact on the probability of recidivism. A smaller number of studies do, however, find significant effects, both positive and negative. The negative, recidivism-reducing effects are mostly in settings in which rehabilitative programming is emphasized and the positive, criminogenic effects are found in settings in which such programming is not emphasized. The findings of studies of pretrial incarceration are more consistent—most find a deleterious effect on postrelease reoffending. We also conclude that additional work is needed to better understand the heterogeneous effects of incarceration as well as the mechanisms through which incarceration effects, when observed, are generated. For policy, our conclusion of the generally deleterious effect of pretrial detention adds to a larger body of evidence pointing to the social value of limiting its use.},

	abstract = {We examine here the predominantly upward trends in incarceration rates in the U.S. over the 30year period, 1980-2010. We examine that in the context of an earlier era of an impressively flat 50-year trend when incarceration was largely controlled by officials within the criminal justice system. This era of stability was followed by a period of considerable politicization of incarceration policy leading to major growth in incarceration from 1980 to 2000. This period was followed by a decade of flatness in state incarceration rates, but with continued growth in the federal incarceration rate. We examine the diverse trajectories of incarceration rates by state and find that all states participated in the rise from 1980 to 2000, with the states with the higher incarcerations rates rising more steeply. That pattern was reversed after 2000, when 16 states had an actual decline in incarceration rates, and that decline was more evident in the states with the higher incarceration rates. We then explore the contribution of different parts of the criminal justice system to the aggregate trends in the states and find that the contribution of the policy areas of commitments per arrest and time served provides the strongest contribution to incarceration growth with little contribution from increases in crime rates or in arrests per crime. Because of the widespread concern over the racial disproportionality in incarceration, we also explore the contribution of differential involvement by whites and blacks in the crimes that lead to prison and examine trends over time in the racial and ethnic disproportionality in prisons. We find that 71 percent of the disproportionality in prison is attributable to differential involvement in arrest for the crimes that lead to prison, and that the disproportionality as measured by the black-to-white incarceration rates has been declining for more than the past 10 years.},

              To test this hypothesis, we utilized 20 years of felony cases. Our analyses employ current best practices for testing interactive effects and decomposition models to identify changes in prison use and the factors associated with these changes.
            
            
              Results
              We find criminal history scores rose sharply, but prison use and racial disparities therein fell markedly in the past decade. The key factors driving these trends are reductions in the influence of criminal history on decision-making, increased use of mitigated departures, and the flexibility of Florida's sentencing system to accommodate mitigated departures. In fact, if Florida's sentencing rules had been followed more closely, racial disparities in prison sentences would have grown.

              This research has implications for reforms aimed at ending mass incarceration and reducing racial disparities in imprisonment.},

              Criminal justice policy in the United States focuses on increasing negative consequences to deter undesired behavior. However, defendants often appear relatively insensitive to these changes in the severity of consequences. Fishbane
              et al.
              considered a different policy lever: improving the communication of information necessary to adhere to desired behavior (see the Perspective by Kohler-Hausmann). They found that redesigning a criminal summons form to highlight critical information and providing text message reminders increased the likelihood that defendants would show up to their appointed court date, thus eliminating a substantial percentage of arrest warrants for failing to appear in court. In follow-up experiments, the authors found that laypeople, but not experts, believe that such failures to appear are relatively intentional, and this belief reduces their support for interventions aimed at increasing awareness rather than punishment. These findings have implications for policies aimed at improving criminal justice outcomes.

              INTRODUCTION
              Each year, millions of people in the United States are required to appear in court for low-level offenses. Many defendants miss their court dates. Criminal justice policy often uses punitive sanctions to deter these failures to appear. For example, when defendants fail to appear, arrest warrants are issued, which draws defendants further into the criminal justice system. These policies presume that defendants pay attention to these penalties and weigh them when deciding whether to appear in court. In this study, we explore a different possibility for why defendants might miss court—simple human error. Although defendants are given all of the relevant information they need, they might be insufficiently aware of this information—it might not be salient enough or defendants might forget it.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              We conducted two large-scale field studies in New York City evaluating interventions to make defendants more aware of court information. In the first study, we redesigned the summons form that defendants receive for low-level offenses. The old summons form listed court information at the bottom of the form below less important information (e.g., the defendant’s physical characteristics and details about the issuing officer), which makes it easy to overlook. The redesigned form moves court information to the top of the ticket, where people are more likely to see it. It also clearly states in bold typeface on the front of the form that missing the assigned court date will lead to a warrant. In the second study, we augmented the redesigned form by sending text messages to highlight critical court information for defendants in the week leading up to their court appearance.
              In laboratory experiments, we tested how quickly people could identify, and how well they could remember, court information on the old and new forms. Then, we examined laypeople’s and experts’ beliefs about whether failures to appear were intentional and how these beliefs affected their support for nudges to reduce failures to appear.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The redesigned summons form and text messages reduced failures to appear on average by 13 and 21\%, respectively. In our laboratory experiments, people who saw the new forms identified court information more quickly (and recalled it more accurately). This suggests that a meaningful proportion of defendants who fail to appear are not intentionally skipping court but are effectively unaware of court.
              We estimate that these nudges helped avoid at least 30,000 arrest warrants being issued over 3 years, and they resulted in approximately 20,000 people having their cases fully dismissed instead of having an open warrant. We see suggestive evidence that these nudges were more effective for defendants living in poorer neighborhoods. Additionally, the bulk of warrants avoided are for defendants living in poorer neighborhoods and neighborhoods with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic residents—though this reflects, rather than repairs, existing disparities in how summonses are issued.
              However, in our laboratory experiments on people’s attitudes, we find that laypeople believe failures to appear for court are more intentional than other failures to act (e.g., missing medical appointments). And although laypeople can be prompted to see how defendants might mistakenly miss court, their default assumption is to see it as intentional. This assumption reduces support for these nudges and increases support for more punitive approaches to reducing failures to appear. Criminal justice experts (e.g., prosecutors and judges), however, do not share this intuition—they are more likely to believe that failures to appear are unintentional and to support these nudges.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              This work suggests that there is a straightforward explanation for why many defendants miss court—information about their court dates is not sufficiently salient. Although simple nudges can remedy this, policy-makers have been slow to experiment with and adopt them. Instead, criminal justice policy on failures to appear often hews closer to laypeople’s intuitions. Widespread adoption of interventions such as these might depend on a shift in the assumptions of why failures to appear happen. Otherwise, these policies risk merely punishing people, not deterring actions.
              
                
                  Reducing failures to appear.
                  In two field studies, we made court information more salient by redesigning the court summons form and sending text messages to defendants. We find that these interventions significantly reduced the rate at which defendants missed their court dates for low-level offenses, and fewer arrest warrants were issued as a result.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            Each year, millions of Americans fail to appear in court for low-level offenses, and warrants are then issued for their arrest. In two field studies in New York City, we make critical information salient by redesigning the summons form and providing text message reminders. These interventions reduce failures to appear by 13 to 21\% and lead to 30,000 fewer arrest warrants over a 3-year period. In laboratory experiments, we find that whereas criminal justice professionals see failures to appear as relatively unintentional, laypeople believe they are more intentional. These lay beliefs reduce support for policies that make court information salient and increase support for punishment. Our findings suggest that criminal justice policies can be made more effective and humane by anticipating human error in unintentional offenses.},

We use data on sexual assaults in Los Angeles, to test for the effects of victim behavior, victim credibility, and “real rape” stereotypes on the decision to file charges. We also test the liberation hypothesis, examining whether rape myths influence the charge decision more in less serious nonpenetrative cases then in penetrative cases. Results show that victim credibility and behavior, but not consistency with real rape stereotypes, affect charging decisions, even after controlling for legally relevant factors, and they influence prosecutors’ charging decisions equally in penetrative and nonpenetrative cases. Rape myths also influence the charging decision indirectly via victim cooperation. We conclude that rape myths are incorporated into the criminal justice system’s definition of and response to sexual violence, so cannot be addressed by changing case screening policies.},

We examine the impact of being on supervision in Michigan on receiving a sentence of imprisonment—comparing the magnitude of the impact reflected in the formal sentencing guideline recommendation with deviations made by court actors. We find that the formal penalty for supervision status is modest, whereas court actors place substantially more weight on current parole status than do the guidelines when deciding to sentence a defendant to prison. They do not seem to give current probation status extra weight in a consistent way. As such, parole is more likely to contribute to cumulative disadvantage stemming from prior punishments. This disproportionately impacts Black defendants because of their higher rates of parole—not through disproportionate sentencing conditional on parole status. Findings suggest that attempts to address factors contributing to cumulative disadvantage will need to consider not only formal rules but also how informal discretion contributes to prison sentences.},

Many are concerned that the use of pretrial risk assessment instruments may be contributing to worsened, not improved, pretrial outcomes, including increased rates of pretrial detention and exacerbated racial disparities in pretrial decisions. These concerns have led prominent organizations to reverse their position on the role of pretrial risk assessment instruments in pretrial system change. Reforms that centered on their use have been rolled back or have failed to be implemented in the first place. However, the scientific evidence behind these concerns is lacking. Instead, the findings of rigorous research show that the results of pretrial risk assessment instruments demonstrate good accuracy in predicting new criminal activity, including violent crime, during the pretrial period, even when there are differences between groups defined by race and ethnicity. Furthermore, the scientific evidence suggests they can be an effective strategy to help achieve pretrial system change, including reducing pretrial detention for people of color and white people, alike, when their results are actually used to inform decision-making. In this article, we review the scientific evidence in relation to three primary critiques of pretrial risk assessment instruments, namely, that their results have poor accuracy and are racially biased and that their use increases pretrial detention rates. We also provide recommendations for addressing these critiques to ensure that their use supports, rather than detracts from, the goals of pretrial reform and articulates an agenda for future research.},

Although the structure and processes of American bail was reshaped considerably over time, the spread of neoconservative and neoliberal rationalities did not radically transform the core identity of the institution. Instead, these political logics had a ‘tinting effect’ on bail, intensifying and altering that which already existed. As such, we frame the case of bail not as a ﬂip from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ penology, but rather of the fusing and reshaping as old practices with new goals, justiﬁcations,and methods.},

This study used data from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing (PCS) for the years 1990 to 2000 to examine how three social psychological aspects of courtroom workgroups (similarity, proximity, and stability) affect sentencing decisions. Results indicated (a) that workgroups generally had very high levels of similarity in terms of race, gender, and political party but lower levels of similarity in terms of age, college education, and law school education and (b) that proximity and stability were generally high. Controlling for individual, case, and distal contextual factors, workgroup factors affected the decision to incarcerate, the decision to impose fines, and the decision to impose restitution. In particular, proximity increased the use of economic sanctions relative to incarceration and stability was associated with a decrease in the imposition of economic sanctions. Similarity had inconsistent effects.},

We find that experienced judges impose more prison sentences, decide fewer cases via shortened procedure and find fewer defendants guilty. In addition, as judges become more experienced, between-judge disparities reduce across all the outcomes considered. Experience is thus an instrumental factor affecting judicial decisions throughout the criminal process, and one that contributes to greater consistency.},

	abstract = {This paper explores some of the more recent developments within crime mapping and the broader application of geographical information technology within law enforcement. The information technology (IT) revolution and the reduction in computing costs since the 1980s has brought a range of analytical tools within the budgets of most police services, and one of the most signiﬁcant changes has been in the way that spatial data are handled. Law enforcement has strong geographic currents at all levels of the organisation, and this paper examines three applications of geographical information systems (GIS) within policing: hotspot mapping; CompStat; and geographic proﬁling. The paper concludes by discussing the future training needs using a simple model of intelligence-led crime reduction. This model suggests that training for managers to enable a greater understanding of the analyses presented to them, and how to use mapping to further crime prevention and reduction, may be as important as increasing the technical ability of crime analysts. The challenge for the immediate future of crime reduction practice in law enforcement is less to worry about the training of analysts, and more to address the inability of law enforcement management to understand and act on the crime analysis they are given.},

Methods Systematic review protocols and conventions of the Campbell Collaboration were followed to identify eligible hot spots policing studies, and meta-analytic techniques were used to assess the impact of hot spots policing on crime and investigate the influence of moderating variables.
Results The search strategies identified 65 studies containing 78 tests of hot spots policing interventions. Meta-analyses revealed a small statistically significant mean effect size favoring the effects of hot spots policing in reducing crime outcomes at treatment places relative to control places. Crime displacement and diffusion effects were measured in 40 tests. Meta-analyses favored a small statistically significant diffusion of crime control benefits over displacement.
Conclusion The extant evaluation research provides fairly robust evidence that hot spots policing is an effective crime prevention strategy. Focused police intervention at hot spot locations does not seem to result in the spatial displacement of crime into areas immediately surrounding targeted locations. Rather, crime control benefits seem to diffuse into proximate areas.},

	abstract = {Objectives Systematically review and synthesize the existing research on communityoriented policing to identify its effects on crime, disorder, fear, citizen satisfaction, and police legitimacy.
Methods We searched a broad range of databases, websites, and journals to identify eligible studies that measured pre-post changes in outcomes in treatment and comparison areas following the implementation of policing strategies that involved community collaboration or consultation. We identified 25 reports containing 65 independent tests of community-oriented policing, most of which were conducted in neighborhoods in the United States. Thirty-seven of these comparisons were included in a meta-analysis.
Results Our findings suggest that community-oriented policing strategies have positive effects on citizen satisfaction, perceptions of disorder, and police legitimacy, but limited effects on crime and fear of crime.
Conclusions Our review provides important evidence for the benefits of community policing for improving perceptions of the police, although our findings overall are ambiguous. The challenges we faced in conducting this review highlight a need for},

	abstract = {The public salience of crime has wide-ranging political and social implications; it influences public trust in the government and citizens’ everyday routines and interactions, and it may affect policy responsiveness to punitive attitudes. Identifying the sources of crime salience is thus important. Two competing theoretical models exist: the objectivist model and the social constructionist model. According to the first, crime salience is a function of the crime rate. According to the second, crime salience is a function of media coverage and political rhetoric, and trends in crime salience differ across population subgroups as a result of differences in their responsiveness to elite initiatives. In both theories, period-level effects predominate. Variation in crime salience, however, may also reflect age and cohort effects. Using data from 422,504 respondents interviewed between 1960 and 2014, we first examine the nature of crime salience using hierarchical age–period–cohort (HAPC) models and then analyze period-level predictors using first differences. We find that 1) crime salience varies mostly at the period level; 2) crime salience trends are parallel (cointegrated) across demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan groups; and 3) crime salience trends within every population subgroup are most consistent with the constructionist model. The crime rate does not exert a significant effect in any subgroup.},

To overcome these challenges, we leverage billions of restricted administrative and survey records linked with the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS). We ﬁnd substantially larger prevalences of intergenerational exposure to the criminal justice system than previously reported: 9\% of children born between 1999–2005 were intergenerationally exposed to prison, 18\% to a felony conviction, and 39\% to any criminal charge; charge exposure rates reach as high as 62\% for Black children. We regress these newly quantiﬁed types of exposure on measures of child well-being to gauge their importance and ﬁnd that all types of exposure (parent vs. non-parent, prison vs. charges, current vs. previous) are strongly negatively correlated with development outcomes, suggesting substantially more U.S. children are harmed by crime and criminal justice than previously thought.},

Criminology has focused heavily on within-person changes in crime, devoting comparatively little attention to changes in aggregate crime rates. In this review, we make a case for integrating research on crime trends into the core of criminology. After describing the late twentieth century crime drop, we present a conceptual framework that situates the study of crime trends in the criminological theoretical literature and illuminates several unresolved questions central to criminological inquiry. We then highlight major shortcomings of current empirical approaches and outline several methodological improvements that would enhance our capacity to describe and explain crime trends.},

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act increased funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) hiring grant program from less than \$20 million over 2005-2008 to \$1 billion in 2009. Hiring grants distributed in 2009 were allocated according to an application score cutoff rule, and I leverage quasi-random variation in grant receipt by comparing the change over time in police and crimes for cities above and below the threshold in a difference in differences framework. Relative to low-scoring cities, those above the cutoff experience increases in police of about 3.2\% and declines in victimization cost-weighted crime of about 3.5\% following the distribution of hiring grants. The effects are driven by large and statistically significant effects of police on robbery, larceny, and auto theft, with suggestive evidence that police reduce murders as well. Crime reductions associated with additional police were more pronounced in areas most affected by the Great Recession. The results highlight that fiscal support to local governments for crime prevention may offer large returns, especially during bad macroeconomic times.},

In this paper we propose an alternative: the neighborhoods out of places explanation (NOPE). NOPE starts with property parcels (i.e., proprietary places), rather than neighborhoods. It focuses on the power and legal authority of people and institutions that own property, rather than on residents. It posits that control is intentional and goal driven, rather than emergent. We refer to those who own and control as creators. This small group of elites shape city areas and residents must adapt to the environments that suppress or facilitate crime.

Methods: Each study was assessed as to whether it solved or reduced each of three critical methodological problems: (1) whether a validated measure of gun prevalence was used, (2) whether the authors controlled for more than a handful of possible confounding variables, and (3) whether the researchers used suitable causal order procedures to deal with the possibility of crime rates affecting gun rates, instead of the reverse.
Results: It was found that most studies did not solve any of these problems, and that research that did a better job of addressing these problems was less likely to support the more-guns-cause-more crime hypothesis. Indeed, none of the studies that solved all three problems supported the hypothesis.
Conclusions: Technically weak research mostly supports the hypothesis, while strong research does not. It must be tentatively concluded that higher gun ownership rates do not cause higher crime rates, including homicide rates.},

In doing so, we examine the impact of incident-level factors, officer characteristics, neighborhood context, and changes in BWC activation policy on whether an officer who is assigned to wear a BWC activates their camera during a police-citizen contact. Cross-classified models are used to simultaneously assess the influence of factors at multiple levels of explanation. Our analysis suggests that a wide variety of individual, situational, organizational, and neighborhood factors are related to an officer’s decision to activate their camera. BWC policy that confines, structures, and checks officer activation has a robust impact on an officer’s decision to activate their BWC.},

	abstract = {While body-worn cameras (BWCs) are increasingly becoming commonplace in police organizations, researchers and policymakers still know little about their implementation in the field and the factors related to their actual use. Using data collected from 146,601 incidents in Phoenix, Arizona, the present study examines the prevalence and correlates of BWC activation. In doing so, we examine the impact of incident-level factors, officer characteristics, neighborhood context, and changes in BWC activation policy on whether an officer who is assigned to wear a BWC activates their camera during a police-citizen contact. Cross-classified models are used to simultaneously assess the influence of factors at multiple levels of explanation. Our analysis suggests that a wide variety of individual, situational, organizational, and neighborhood factors are related to an officer’s decision to activate their camera. BWC policy that confines, structures, and checks officer activation has a robust impact on an officer’s decision to activate their BWC.},

	abstract = {The most influential agenda for progressive police reform today aims to shrink the police footprint by reassigning many problems they currently manage to other institutions. This paper argues that this agenda relies on faulty understanding of the police role, but a more promising agenda based on a better understanding is available. Police are a residual institution, charged with managing the crises that other institutions cannot handle adequately on their own, and it is not easy to reassign that work to anyone else. In the course of doing it, however, they develop expertise in the nature and sources of these crises that positions them to identify and help repair the institutional failures that generate them. The paper illustrates these claims with case studies of the challenges that efforts to reassign police work elsewhere have encountered and the role that police have played in institutional repair. It concludes by considering he normative concerns that this important aspect of the police role raises.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Since the 1990's, governmental and non-governmental organizations have adopted several measures to increase access to the opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone. These include the implementation of laws that increase layperson naloxone access and overdose-speciﬁc Good Samaritan laws that protect those reporting overdoses from criminal sanction. The association of these legal changes with overdose mortality and non-medical opioid use is unknown. We assess the relationship of (1) naloxone access laws and (2) overdose Good Samaritan laws with opioid-overdose mortality and non-medical opioid use in the United States.
Methods: We used 2000–2014 National Vital Statistics System data, 2002–2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, and primary datasets of the location and timing of naloxone access laws and overdose Good Samaritan laws.
Results: By 2014, 30 states had a naloxone access and/or Good Samaritan law. States with naloxone access laws or Good Samaritan laws had a 14\% (p = 0.033) and 15\% (p = 0.050) lower incidence of opioid-overdose mortality, respectively. Both law types exhibit diﬀerential association with opioid-overdose mortality by race and age. No signiﬁcant relationships were observed between any of the examined laws and non-medical opioid use.
Conclusions: Laws designed to increase layperson engagement in opioid-overdose reversal were associated with reduced opioid-overdose mortality. We found no evidence that these measures were associated with increased non-medical opioid use.},

	abstract = {Background: Injecting drugs safely almost always includes the presence of one’s social network, especially for the prevention of overdose. Yet, the systematic analysis of users’ social networks has yet to be established as a focal method in harm reduction research, and interventions.
Methods: This study draws from 200 interviews with persons who inject drugs recruited from North America’s ﬁrst sanctioned supervised injection facility and a drug user’s advocacy group. Respondents were asked about the individuals they personally considered as facilitators of harm reduction, and the relations between them. Collectively, these 200 respondents provided over 900 individuals whom they considered as members of their harm reduction network. The aim was to locate individuals that would potentially make the network denser (harm reduction champions) and users that were situated in the “periphery” of the network, and in practice, further away from the harm reduction core.
Results: Of the 1135 network members, 63 individuals formed the “core” of the harm reduction network, collectively reaching approximately 70\% of individuals in the network. We also uncovered 31 individuals that acted as “articulation points”– these individuals were not as connected, but were more effective at reaching peripheral individuals.
Conclusion: Former or current injecting drug users that were sampled were surrounded by a relatively rich harm reduction network, but the network approach showed that only a minority of individuals were true harm reduction “champions”. Recruitment of a combination of well-connected harm reduction champions, and strategically connected articulation points, would be most effective in planning network interventions that encourage harm reduction behaviors among this population.},

Yet, in outcome analyses of these programs, the rich and complicated set of peer network dynamics is often reduced to an aggregation of individual characteristics or assessed with methods that do not account for the interdependencies of network data. In this paper, we present concepts and analytic methods from the field of social network analysis and illustrate their great value to prevention science—both as a source of tools for refining program theories and as methods that enable more sophisticated and focused tests of intervention effects.

Some physicians in the USA may be discouraged from distributing naloxone, however, by legal concerns. A legal analysis ﬁnds that the legal risks are low.

I analyze a unique relational database on organized crime from the early 1900s via a criminal network that tripled in size and centralized during Prohibition. Before Prohibition, Chicago organized crime was small, decentralized, and somewhat inclusive of women at the margins. However, during Prohibition, the organized crime network grew, consolidated the organizational elites, and left out the most vulnerable participants from the most profitable opportunities. This historical case illuminates how profits and organizational restructuring outside of (or in response to) regulatory environments can displace people at the margins.},

In contrast with Simmel, I argue that secret societies under risk must be differentiated from others; that societies under risk have a wide range of structural forms; and that the major sources of structure are found in preexisting social structures rather than in psychological factors. Risk enforces recruitment along lines of trust, thus through preexisting networks of relationships, which set the limits of the secret society's structure. Structure can still vary considerably, depending primarily on the centralization of control of recruitment, in turn dependent on the control of key resources.},

            Gang members frequently refer to street life as a “game” (or “The Game”): a social milieu in which status is lost or won by the way individuals and groups manage their reputations. Like other games, successfully participating in the street game may demand adherence to certain rules, such as the willingness to violently redress threats, the avoidance of “weak” behaviors, and the protection of one’s allies. This paper draws on detailed police records of violent exchanges among gangs in Chicago to ascertain which rules of the game in fact contribute to the relative social standing of groups. Specifically, we use exponential random graph models to identify the underlying micro-arrangements among gangs that collectively generate macro-level patterns of homicide. Findings illuminate a large and diverse array of generative mechanisms based on gangs’ attributes and structural positions. However, these mechanisms vary depending on which two gangs are at hand; provide evidence of a contested hierarchy with few intergroup alliances; and are surprisingly inconsistent over time. As all gangs engage in local and ongoing struggles for dominance—and as the rules constantly change—the street game is continually played but never truly won.},

Socially vulnerable youth are frequently harassed for violating norms, but the logic of status competition implies they are not the only victims: to the extent that aggression is instrumental for social climbing, increases in status should increase risk—at least until the pinnacle of the hierarchy is reached. Victimization causes serious harm, and, we argue, at the margin these consequences will be magnified by status. We test these ideas using longitudinal network data on friendship and victimization from 19 schools. For most students, status increases the risk of victimization. However, youth at the uppermost extremes of the school hierarchy—students in the top 5 percent of centrality and those with cross-gender friendships where such friendships are rare—sit just above the fray, unlikely to fall victim to their peers. As expected, females and physically or socially vulnerable youth are victimized at particularly high rates. Victims experience psychological distress and social marginalization, and these adverse effects are magnified by status. For most students, gains in status increase the likelihood of victimization and the severity of its consequences.},

	abstract = {Nearly a century of empirical research examines how neighborhood properties influence a host of phenomena such as crime, poverty, health, civic engagement, immigration, and economic inequality. Theoretically bundled within these neighborhood effects are institutions’ and actors’ social networks that are the foundation of other neighborhood-level processes such as social control, mobilization, and cultural assimilation. Yet, despite such long-standing theoretical links between neighborhoods and social networks, empirical research rarely considers or measures dimensions of geography and social network mechanisms simultaneously. The present study seeks to fill this gap by analyzing how both geography and social networks influence an important social problem in urban America: gang violence. Using detailed data on fatal and non-fatal shootings, we examine effects of geographic proximity, organizational memory, and additional group processes (e.g., reciprocity, transitivity, and status seeking) on gang violence in Chicago and Boston. Results show adjacency of gang turf and prior conflict between gangs are strong predictors of subsequent gang violence. Furthermore, important network processes, including reciprocity and status seeking, also contribute to observed patterns of gang violence. In fact, we find that these spatial and network processes mediate racial effects, suggesting the primacy of place and the group in generating gang violence.},

	abstract = {Bureaucratic and patrimonial theories of organized crime tend to miss the history and mobility of crime groups integrating into and organizing with legitimate society. The network property of multiplexity—when more than one type of relationship exists between a pair of actors—offers a theoretical and empirical inroad to analyzing overlapping relationships of seemingly disparate social spheres. Using the historical case of organized crime in Chicago and a unique relational database coded from more than 5,000 pages of archival documents, we map the web of multiplex relationships among bootleggers, politicians, union members, businessmen, families, and friends. We analyze the overlap of criminal, personal, and legitimate networks containing 1,030 individuals and 3,726 mutual dyads between them. Multiplexity is rare in these data: only 10 percent of the mutual dyads contain multiplex ties. However, results from bivariate exponential random graph models demonstrate that multiplexity is a relevant structural property binding the three networks together. Even among our sample of criminals, we find dependencies between the criminal and personal networks and the criminal and legitimate networks. Although not pervasive, multiplexity glued these worlds of organized crime together above and beyond the personalities of famous gangsters, ethnic homophily, and other endogenous network processes.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes Martin Luther’s role in spreading the early Reformation, one of the most important episodes of radical institutional change in the last millennium. We argue that social relations played a key role in its diffusion because the spread of heterodox ideologies and their eventual institutionalization relied not only on private “infection” through exposure to innovation but also on active conversion and promotion of that new faith through personal ties. We conceive of that process as leader-to-follower directional influence originating with Luther and flowing to local elites through personal ties. Based on novel data on Luther’s correspondence, Luther’s visits, and student enrollments in Luther’s city of Wittenberg, we reconstruct Luther’s influence network to examine whether local connections to him increased the odds of adopting Protestantism. Using regression analyses and simulations based on empirical network data, we find that the combination of personal/relational diffusion via Luther’s multiplex ties and spatial/structural diffusion via trade routes fostered cities’ adoption of the Reformation, making possible Protestantism’s early breakthrough from a regional movement to a general rebellion against the Roman Catholic Church.},

Data from international surveys have documented wide variation in anomie across nations, but to what extent this variation among nations can be contributed to structural characteristics has not been explored before. Using hierarchical linear modeling techniques to sort out the effects of structural context and personal characteristics on anomie across 31 European and North American nations, the authors test the hypothesis that variation in social support at the national level is inversely related to individuals’ sense of anomie. The study results support the hypothesis that structural characteristics of a nation, such as social support and population growth, influence individuals’ sense of anomie. At the individual level, the results are consistent with Merton’s predictions about anomie and the reasoning of social support theory. Policy implication is discussed within the limitations of data.},

First, drawing upon desistance theory it attempts to develop a theoretical underpinning for mentoring practice with ex-offenders that would identify appropriate targets for mentoring practice, including the development of social capital or connectedness. Part two of the article utilises data from research on a women’s mentoring program in Victoria, Australia, to understand how one key dimension of desistance — social capital — is recognised by women as a domain of need and those women’s perceptions of the way mentoring may deliver gains in social connectedness and capital. The article concludes with a discussion of the distinctly gendered nature of women’s postprison experiences and the way in which these factors shape both the process of desistance and the nature of mentoring interventions.},

Findings from the qualitative component of the research highlight the helpfulness of networks members who provided transportation, financial assistance, and emotional support.

Most prisoners are not embedded in a personal network saturated with criminal influence before coming to prison.

Knowing how individuals in prison establish relationships of trust with one another is crucial for understanding how individuals adjust to conditions of confinement. Using data from 133 incarcerated women in a Pennsylvania prison unit, this study adopts a network approach to examine the role of individual and structural determinants of trust using exponential random graph models. Findings provide weak support for the claim that individual determinants (e.g. age, religious affiliation) shape whether women are more likely to trust someone to support them during an argument or a dispute. Instead, our findings show that structural determinants are the primary drivers of trust relationships. Trust is deeply entwined with friendship relations among women who get along with each other. Our approach paves a new path for the examination of trust in correctional settings and other criminological contexts.},

Based on qualitative interviews with 68 incarcerated drug dealers in Norway, we explore dealers’ perspectives on fair prices and the processes that influence their pricing decisions. Synthesized through economic sociology, we draw on perspectives from traditions as different as behavioral economics and cultural analysis to demonstrate how participants in illicit drug distribution base their pricing decisions on institutional context, social networks, and drug market cultures. We find that dealers take institutional constraints into consideration and search for niches with high earnings and low risks. The use of transactions embedded in social networks promotes a trusting form of governance, which enables strategic network management and expedient distribution but also uncompetitive pricing. Finally, dealers’ pricing decisions are embedded in three different cultures narratives: business, friendship, and street cultural stories, with widely varying implications for prices. Our findings demonstrate how an economic sociology of illicit drug distribution can extend insights from behavioral economics and cultural studies into a coherent criminology of illegal drug markets.},

	abstract = {Similarity breeds connection. This principle—the homophily principle—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

	abstract = {The increase in punitive sentiment in America over the last four decades is frequently attributed to changes in criminal justice policies and programs. While scholars have studied the impact of legislation and policy on justice system outcomes, less attention has focused on the role of political actors in legislative bodies who are largely responsible for enacting criminal justice legislation. The current study addresses this gap by examining the social organization of federal crime control policy in the U.S. Congress over a forty-two year period (1973–2014). Drawing from research on social network mechanisms, we examine whether crime control legislation was more politically attractive relative to other legislative topics, and whether Democrats and Republicans pursue these policies by working together or competing against each other. Our results provide novel insight into the mechanisms that contributed to the punitive movement at the federal level.},

	abstract = {Self-control theory (Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990) argues that individuals with similar attributes tend to ‘end up together’ (i.e., homophily) because of the tendency to select friends based on self-control. Studies documenting homophily in peer groups interpret the correlation between self-control, peer delinquency, and self-reported delinquency as evidence that self-control is an inﬂuential factor in friendship formation. However, past studies are limited because they do not directly test the hypothesis that selfcontrol inﬂuences friendship selection, nor do they account for other mechanisms that may inﬂuence decisions. As a result, it is unclear whether the correlation between individual and peer behavior is the result of selection based on self-control or alternative mechanisms. To address this gap in the literature this study employs exponential random graph modeling to test hypotheses derived from self-control theory using approximately 63,000 respondents from 59 schools from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). In contrast to the predictions made by Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990), and the conclusions drawn from prior research, there is little evidence that self-control inﬂuences friendship selection. The ﬁndings are embedded in past work on the relationship between self-control and peer relationships, and implications for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {This article develops and assesses the concept of triple neighborhood disadvantage. We argue that a neighborhood’s well-being depends not only on its own socioeconomic conditions but also on the conditions of neighborhoods its residents visit and are visited by, connections that form through networks of everyday urban mobility. We construct measures of mobilitybased disadvantage using geocoded patterns of movement estimated from hundreds of millions of tweets sent by nearly 400,000 Twitter users over 18 months. Analyzing nearly 32,000 neighborhoods and 9,700 homicides in 37 of the largest U.S. cities, we show that neighborhood triple disadvantage independently predicts homicides, adjusting for traditional neighborhood correlates of violence, spatial proximity to disadvantage, prior homicides, and city fixed effects. Not only is triple disadvantage a stronger predictor than traditional measures, it accounts for a sizable portion of the association between residential neighborhood disadvantage and homicides. In turn, potential mechanisms such as neighborhood drug activity, interpersonal friction, and gun crime prevalence account for much of the association between triple disadvantage and homicides. These findings implicate structural mobility patterns as an important source of triple (dis)advantage for neighborhoods and have implications for a broad range of phenomena beyond crime, including community capacity, gentrification, transmission in a pandemic, and racial inequality.},

            This study uses observational, social network, and self-report survey data from a large study of male gangs in Chicago, 1959–62, to examine intragroup relationships and behaviors among their female auxiliaries, particularly the Vice Ladies and Cobraettes. Unlike descriptions of the female gang as forming a cohesive “sisterhood,” our findings revealed frequent intragroup conflict and loosely connected friendship networks. Consistent with the bulk of contemporary literature, the Chicago gang girls appeared to maintain ties with one another less for affective reasons than for the benefits they provided in the streets (e.g., peer backup). Regarding their behaviors, the Chicago gang girls engaged in both socio-sexual and stereotypically male activities, including strong-arm robbery and purse-snatching. Although sex sometimes was used to gain favor with boys, we found no evidence of it being valued and rewarded with prestige among homegirls. Instead, the most sexually active girls tended to be the least popular in the gang. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of “bad girl femininity” performed by gang girls and gang involvement as a resource for “bargaining with patriarchy.”},

	abstract = {Objectives This study proposes a theoretical framework for understanding two empirical ﬁndings from gang research: (1) gangs are generally racially homogenous, even in heterogeneous environments, and (2) gang violence tends to be intra-racial. We draw from the extensive literature on street gangs as well as from research on group formation and status-enhancing behavior to develop a theoretical model of gang formation.
Methods Using game theory, we model the simultaneous decisions of individuals to commit status-enhancing acts of violence and to seek protection by joining a gang. We then conduct computer simulations to examine the resulting patterns of violence and gang composition.
Results We demonstrate that as long as some social distance exists between racial groups in a community, gang violence will be intra-racial and gangs will be homogenous. We ﬁnd that our results are robust to a number of simple variations of the model and allow us to generate several hypotheses about the nature of gang formation and patterns of violence.
Conclusions When violence is motivated by socially constructed rewards, socially closer targets are likely to yield greater rewards. In such a system, individuals must reduce their likelihood of victimization by entering a social contract of non-violence (i.e. gang membership) with individuals who might view them as status-enhancing targets (i.e. socially close individuals). The result is that gangs are made up of socially close individuals interested in attacking other socially close individuals. Therefore, gangs tend to be racially homogenous and violence is overwhelmingly intra-racial.},

Relying on longitudinal data for a random sample of delinquents from Philadelphia, this study begins by constructing egocentric co-offending networks for the respondents.Then, using Tobit regression models, it finds that higher levels of co-offender network redundancy (more dense networks) are related to higher levels of specialized offending in group crimes, but no such relationship exists with overall (i.e., solo and group) offending specialization.

We ﬁnd strong support for police reform, but e↵orts to defund or abolish generate opposition both in terms of slogan and substance. While these di↵erences cannot be explained by di↵ering beliefs about each movement’s association with violent protests, racial makeup, or speciﬁc programmatic changes, e↵orts to defund and abolish the police appear unpopular because they seek reduced involvement of police in traditional roles and cuts in police numbers. Our ﬁndings suggest that public support for changes to American policing is contingent on the perceived implications for crime and public safety. Proposals like defunding and abolition are therefore unlikely to succeed at the national level. Viable police reform may instead require proposals that target changing how police departments and their o cers operate rather than lowering police budgets or decreasing police involvement in responding to crime and calls for service.},

	abstract = {In this article, the authors present a life-course perspective on crime and a critique of the developmental criminology paradigm. Their fundamental argument is that persistent offending and desistance—or trajectories of crime—can be meaningfully understood within the same theoretical framework, namely, a revised agegraded theory of informal social control. The authors examine three major issues. First, they analyze data that undermine the idea that developmentally distinct groups of offenders can be explained by unique causal processes. Second, they revisit the concept of turning points from a time-varying view of key life events. Third, they stress the overlooked importance of human agency in the development of crime. The authors' life-course theory envisions development as the constant interaction between individuals and their environment, coupled with random developmental noise and a purposeful human agency that they distinguish from rational choice. Contrary to influential developmental theories in criminology, the authors thus conceptualize crime as an emergent process reducible neither to the individual nor the environment.},

In this review, we consider how criminologists have sought to identify change in the criminal career by reﬂecting on the identiﬁcation and measurement of turning points. We contend that important life events, such as marriage and employment, are endogenous to the desistance process and as such present challenges for scholars regarding the causal identiﬁcation of turning points. Speciﬁcally, we argue that both selection bias and simultaneity bias are fundamental principles of the life-course framework. We present a formal way to think about the causal identiﬁcation of turning points in the face of endogeneity and also consider several conceptual issues relating to the deﬁnition and measurement of turning points. In the end, we encourage scholars to adopt creative methodological strategies to unpack turning points.},

Of interest, a handful of studies have identified a group of individuals whose early childhood years were marked by extensive antisocial behavior but who seemed to recover and desist (at least from severe offending) in adolescence and early adulthood. We use data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development to examine the adult adjustment outcomes of different groups of offenders, including a recoveries group, in late middle adulthood, offering the most comprehensive investigation of this particular group to date. Findings indicate that abstainers comprise the largest group of males followed by adolescence-limited offenders, recoveries, and life-course persistent offenders. Furthermore, the results reveal that a host of adult adjustment problems measured at ages 32 and 48 in a number of life-course domains are differentially distributed across these four offender groups. In addition, the recoveries and life-course persistent offenders often show the greatest number of adult adjustment problems relative to the adolescencelimited offenders and abstainers.},

This may aggravate already elevated burdens of officer stress and burnout, while chilling lifesaving overdose response. Police education has shown promise in reducing false beliefs about fentanyl. To better understand the potential of training interventions in correcting officer knowledge, we administered a 10-min online training with corrective messaging about occupational overdose risk from fentanyl contact to 204 police officers in Indiana. Overall, 129 officers (63\%) completed baseline survey and 69 (34\%) completed follow-up instrument. Using a 6-point Likert scale, we documented assent with the statement: “First responders who encounter fentanyl are at great risk of overdose by touching it or inhaling it.” At baseline, 79.8\% expressed agreement, while 20.2\% disagreed. At follow-up, 39.1\% agreed, while 60.9\% disagreed (p {\textless} .001). Baseline responses varied in that those officers without a college degree and those on patrol were more likely to report false beliefs.

Though intuitively appealing, this perspective is not readily amenable to falsification. Consequently, most empirical evaluations of institutional anomie theory have examined the additive and multiplicative effects of the structural antecedents of the institutional imbalance of power and anomie on violent and property crime rates.

CRT sprang up in the late 1980s when the Civil Rights Movement stalled; new theories were needed to cope with emerging forms of institutional or "colorblind" racism and a public that seemed tired of hearing about race. Critical race theorists showed how racism is routine, not exceptional, and that liberal accounts were inadequate to understand its persistence and power. Although Critical Race Theory has provided many useful insights, it has largely left crime and criminal justice unexplored. Delgado and Stefancic review the history of CRT, including the small number of efforts to come to terms with crime and delinquency by CRT scholars, and list a number of issues that seem ripefor critical analysis. They also show how such critical tools as interest convergence, social constructionism, differential racialization, legal storytelling, and the critique of White normativity may help understand society's fixation on Blacic and Latino criminality. They conclude by urging critical scholars to devote more attention to crime and race and to propose a research agenda for the future.},

	abstract = {Objectives We highlight the importance of documenting the step-by-step processes used for the selection of comparison areas when evaluating a community-level intervention that targets a large-scale community.
Methods We demonstrate the proposed method using a propensity score matching framework for an impact analysis of the Cure Violence Public Health Model in Philadelphia. To select comparison communities, propensity score models are run using different levels of aggregation to define the intervention site. We discuss the trade-offs made.
Results We find wide variation in documentation and explanation in the extant literature of the methods used to select comparison communities. The size of the unit of analysis at which a community is measured complicates the decision processes, and in turn, can affect the validity of the counterfactual.
Conclusions It is important to carefully consider the unit of analysis for measurement of comparison communities. Assessing the geographic clustering of matched communities to mirror that of the treated community holds conceptual appeal and represents a strategy to consider when evaluating community-level interventions taking place at a large scale. Regardless of the final decisions made in the selection of the counterfactual, the field could benefit from more systematic diagnostic tools that document and guide the steps and decisions along the way, and ask: Bcould there have been another way of doing each step, and what difference would this have made?{\textasciicircum} Overall, across community-level evaluations},

	abstract = {Ex-prisoners tend to be geographically concentrated in a relatively small number of neighborhoods within the most resource deprived sections of metropolitan areas. Furthermore, many prisoners return “home” to the same criminogenic environment with the same criminal opportunities and criminal peers that proved so detrimental prior to incarceration. Yet estimating the causal impact of place of residence on the likelihood of recidivism is complicated by the issue of selection bias. In this study, I use a natural experiment as a means of addressing the selection issue and examine whether the migration of ex-prisoners away from their former place of residence will lead to lower levels of recidivism. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Louisiana Gulf Coast, damaging many of the neighborhoods where ex-prisoners typically reside. The residential destruction resulting from Hurricane Katrina is an exogenous source of variation that influences where a parolee will reside upon release from prison. Findings reveal that moving away from former geographic areas substantially lowers a parolee's likelihood of re-incarceration.},

	abstract = {Objective This study examines whether single-item attitude measures commonly used in research adequately capture adolescent attitudes towards speciﬁc delinquent behaviors. It also explores whether delinquent attitudes form a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. Finally, this study tests Ajzen and Fishbein’s principle of compatibility to determine if delinquent attitudes have a behavior-speciﬁc and a situation-speciﬁc effect on behavior.
Methods Data from a sample of 223 high school students in the Paciﬁc Northwest (PNW) and from the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) evaluation are used. The means and correlations between single-item global attitude items are compared to situation-speciﬁc measures. Exploratory factor analysis is conducted to examine dimensionality, and logit regressions are used to predict the willingness to offend in the PNW and selfreported offending in the GREAT.
Results The ﬁndings indicate that: (1) global attitude measures underestimate the degree of approval of delinquency and are not strongly correlated with situation-speciﬁc attitudes; (2) delinquent attitudes form a multidimensional construct that coalesce around crimetypes; (3) there is some evidence that attitudes towards speciﬁc crimes have crime-speciﬁc effects on behavior, and; (4) situation-speciﬁc attitudes predict the willingness to offend in a speciﬁc situation above and beyond one’s overall approval of that behavior.
Conclusions Attitudes towards ﬁghting and theft are too complex to be captured by single-item measures. The ﬁndings also support the principle of compatibility which suggests that attitudes may be well-suited to explain why individual engage in speciﬁc types of crimes in speciﬁc situations. Other implications and limitations are discussed.},

Criminological research, however, has not sufficiently incorporated social psychological theory predicting the reverse causal relationship, and tends to suffer from important methodological limitations. The present study addresses these issues using longitudinal data from the New Hampshire Youth Study (N = 626). After using latent variable models to demonstrate the discriminant validity of attitudinal and behavioral measures, it uses structural equation models to examine whether attitudes are stronger predictors of behavior or vice versa. Net of controls, results provide qualified support for a reciprocal relationship but suggest that behavior affects attitudes much more than attitudes affect behavior.

	abstract = {Purpose: Promote the use of multilevel modelling to refine theories of police discretion. Specifically, examine the simultaneous influence of situational factors, responding officers, and neighborhood context on arrests guided by a social-ecological framework. Methods: Cross-classified models were used to assess the outcomes of 835,381 incidents responded to by 835 Phoenix Police officers in 388 census tracts. Results: Situational, officer, and neighborhood factors all significantly influence arrests. Incident-level factors account for most of the variation, followed by officers, and neighborhoods. Incidents that resulted in arrest were more likely to involve victims, a greater number of responding officers, female officers, and college-educated officers. Arrests were more likely to occur in Hispanic and Black neighborhoods, even when controlling for situational and officer-level characteristics. Arrests were less likely to occur when officers were assigned to high crime precincts. Conclusions: Multilevel models enable a comprehensive examination of police use of arrest using administrative data that are already being collected by police agencies. Through accounting for both officer and neighborhood-level influences, this strategy improves on prior theory testing in policing research. The results support elements of some theories, but conflict with others. These findings have important implications for police policies surrounding arrest and resource deployment.},

It insists that it is no longer possible to understand crime and control separately from how they are represented.

Scholars agree in theory that randomized experimental studies have higher internal validity than do nonrandomized studies.

To examine these issues, the authors look at the relationship between research design and study outcomes in a broad review of research evidence on crime and justice commissioned by the National Institute of Justice. Their findings suggest that design does have a systematic effect on outcomes in criminal justice studies. The weaker a design, indicated by internal validity, the more likely a study is to report a result in favor of treatment and the less likely it is to report a harmful effect of treatment. Even when comparing randomized studies with strong quasi-experimental research designs, systematic and statistically significant differences are observed.},

These highly endorsed interventions, however, are not supported by a strong body of empirical evidence that demonstrates their effectiveness.

Yet for an increasing number of Americans, the criminal justice system plays a powerful and pervasive role in providing a civic education, in anticitizenry, that is the reverse of the education that public schools are supposed to offer. We deploy curriculum theory to analyze three primary processes of the criminal justice system—jury service, incarceration, and policing—and demonstrate the operation of two parallel curricula within them: a symbolic, overt curriculum rooted in positive civic conceptions of fairness and democracy; and a hidden curriculum, rooted in empty or negative conceptions of certain citizens and their relationship to the state.},

In this review, I assess the current state of self-control knowledge and encourage the field to move beyond SCT, as its peculiar conceptualization of self-control and the causal model present challenges for integrative scholarship. Drawing heavily on scholarship outside criminology, I clarify the definition of self-control; describe the malleable nature of trait self-control; highlight its situational variability as state self-control; and consider the multiplicity of contextual, situational, and individual factors that affect its operation in relation to crime. This specification of contingencies and the interplay between impulse strength and control efforts in the process of self-control is intended as a springboard for research moving beyond SCT and its key premise that self-control (ability) is sufficient to explain individual variation in crime (i.e., is tantamount to criminality). Finally, I address what I see as important areas for further study in light of current knowledge.},

Methods: A total of 796 studies were reviewed for inclusion/exclusion criteria and yielded a ﬁnal study sample of 99 studies (88 cross-sectional and 19 longitudinal effect sizes, analyzed separately). Random effects mean correlations between self-control and deviance were analyzed for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, respectively. Publication bias was assessed using multiple methods.
Results: A random effects mean correlation between self-control and deviance was Mr = 0.415 for cross-sectional studies and Mr = 0.345 for longitudinal ones; this effect did not signiﬁcantly differ by study design. Studies with more male participants, studies based on older or US-based populations, and self-report studies found weaker effects.
Conclusions: Substantial empirical support was found for the main argument of self-control theory and on the transdisciplinary link between self-control and measures of crime and deviance. In contrast to Pratt and Cullen, but consistent with theory, the effect from cross-sectional versus longitudinal studies did not signiﬁcantly differ. There was no evidence of publication bias.},

	abstract = {The group engagement model expands the insights of the group-value model of procedural justice and the relational model of authority into an explanation for why procedural justice shapes cooperation in groups, organizations, and societies. It hypothesizes that procedures are important because they shape people's social identity within groups, and social identity in turn influences attitudes, values, and behaviors. The model further hypothesizes that resource judgments exercise their influence indirectly by shaping social identity. This social identity mediation hypothesis explains why people focus on procedural justice, and in particular on procedural elements related to the quality of their interpersonal treatment, because those elements carry the most social identity-relevant information. In this article, we review several key insights of the group engagement model, relate these insights to important trends in psychological research on justice, and discuss implications of the model for the future of procedural justice research.},

Hirschi carefully examined the underlying assumptions of extant theories of crime in light of what was known about the individual-level correlates of offending. He then developed critical tests of hypotheses derived from social control theory and competing perspectives and empirically assessed them using original self-report delinquency data. Many of his key findings, such as the negative correlation between attachment to parents and delinquency, are now established facts that any explanation of crime must consider. Causes of Delinquency is still cited hundreds of times per year, and it continues to spark new research and theoretical development in the field. Perhaps the most lasting legacy is the volume of criticism it has attracted and fended off, leading to its enduring contribution to the study of crime and delinquency.},

This requires developing generalizations or principles on the nature of effective police strategies and translating the field of police evaluation research into digestible forms that can be used to alter police tactics, strategies, accountability systems, and training. In this article, we present a tool intended for such use: the Evidence-Based Policing Matrix. The Matrix is a consistently updated, research-to-practice translation tool that categorizes and visually bins all experimental and quasi-experimental research on police and crime reduction into intersections between three common dimensions of crime prevention—the nature of the target, the extent to which the strategy is proactive or reactive, and the specificity or generality of the strategy. Our mapping and visualization of 97 police evaluation studies conducted through December 31, 2009, indicate that proactive, place-based, and specific policing approaches appear much more promising in reducing crime than individual-based, reactive, and general ones. We conclude by discussing how the Matrix can be used to guide future research and facilitate the adoption of evidencebased policing.},

Incentives have long been the province of economics, which has wide inﬂuence in criminology (e.g., Becker 1968). However, economics has evolved considerably since Becker’s inﬂuential model. An important development has been the advent of behavioral economics, which some consider a branch of economics on par with macroeconomics or econometrics (Dhami 2016). Behavioral economics integrates empirical departures from traditional microeconomic theories into a rigorous and more descriptively accurate economic model of choice. This review explains how behavioral economic applications on offender decision-making can help reﬁne criminological theories of choice and identify innovative possibilities for improving crime-control policies.},

Using random effects Tobit models of perceived risk and negative binomial models of counts of criminal acts, the authors find support for a rational choice model. Perceived risk follows a Bayesian updating model in which current risk perceptions are a function of prior risk perceptions plus new information based on experience with crime and arrest and observations of peers. Theft and violence are a function of the perceived risk of arrest, subjective psychic rewards (including excitement and social status), and perceived opportunities.},

	abstract = {Background: In a seminal study of gene-environment interaction, childhood maltreatment predicted antisocial behavior more strongly in male subjects carrying an MAOA promoter variant of lesser, compared with higher, transcriptional efﬁciency. Many further investigations have been reported, including studies of other early environmental exposures and female subjects. Here, we report a meta-analysis of studies testing the interaction of MAOA genotype and childhood adversities on antisocial outcomes in predominantly nonclinical samples.
Methods: Included were 27 peer-reviewed, English-language studies published through August, 2012, that contained indicators of maltreatment or other family (e.g., parenting, sociodemographic) hardships; MAOA genotype; indices of aggressive and antisocial behavior; and statistical test of genotype-environment interaction. Studies of forensic and exclusively clinical samples, clinical cohorts lacking proportionally matched control subjects, or outcomes nonspeciﬁc for antisocial behavior were excluded. The Liptak-Stouffer weighted Z-test for meta-analysis was implemented to maximize study inclusion and calculated separately for male and female cohorts.
Results: Across 20 male cohorts, early adversity presaged antisocial outcomes more strongly for low-activity, relative to high- activity, MAOA genotype (p ¼ .0044). Stratiﬁed analyses showed the interaction speciﬁc to maltreatment (p ¼ .00000082) and robust to several sensitivity analyses. Across 11 female cohorts, MAOA did not interact with combined early life adversities, whereas maltreatment alone predicted antisocial behaviors preferentially, but weakly, in female subjects of high-activity MAOA genotype (p ¼ .02).
Conclusions: We found common regulatory variation in MAOA to moderate effects of childhood maltreatment on male antisocial behaviors, conﬁrming a sentinel ﬁnding in research on gene-environment interaction. An analogous, but less consistent, ﬁnding in female subjects warrants further investigation.},

Achieving a greater voice in the world outside the discipline will require a concerted move toward a more explicitly public criminology, and seeing to it that the work of such a criminology is more reliably supported and rewarded within the universities and the profession as a whole.},

This never solidified into a strong subdiscipline akin to psychometrics, however. After briefly discussing the goals of measurement and how they correspond to the explanation of criminal events and behavior, the authors consider how the prevailing methodological paradigm, which relies heavily on analysis of a limited number of data sets via variable-based regression techniques, may constrain measurement progress on the whole. In doing so, they highlight the imbalance between the growing sophistication of analytic models and the relative stagnation of the employed data sets and measures. The article then provides some examples of exceptions to this broad trend—both in terms of data collection and measurement techniques. Finally, the authors consider basic lessons drawn from these innovative approaches to measurement.},

In this review, we outline the basics of replication, summarize reproducibility problems found in other ﬁelds, undertake an original analysis of the amount and nature of replication studies appearing in criminology journals, and consider how criminology can begin to assess more formally the robustness of our knowledge through encouraging a culture of replication.},

Although causal identiﬁcation is indeed important and observational data present numerous challenges to causal inference, we argue that conﬂating causality with the method used to identify it leads to a cognitive narrowing that diverts attention from what ultimately matters most—the difference between counterfactual worlds that emerge as a consequence of their being subjected to different treatment regimes applied to all eligible population members over a sustained period of time. To address this system-level and long-term challenge, we develop an analytic framework for integrating causality and policy inference that accepts the mandate of causal rigor but is conceptually rather than methodologically driven. We then apply our framework to two substantive areas that have generated high-visibility experimental research and that have considerable policy inﬂuence: (a) hot-spots policing and (b) the use of housing vouchers to reduce concentrated disadvantage and thereby crime. After reviewing the research in these two areas in light of our framework, we propose a research path forward and conclude with implications for the interplay of theory, data, and causal understanding in criminology and other social sciences.},

We suggest that the narrow conception of change adopted within criminology has hindered the ﬁeld’s capacity to develop a stronger scientiﬁc understanding of crime trends. Criminology has focused heavily on within-person changes in crime, devoting comparatively little attention to changes in aggregate crime rates. In this review, we make a case for integrating research on crime trends into the core of criminology. After describing the late twentieth century crime drop, we present a conceptual framework that situates the study of crime trends in the criminological theoretical literature and illuminates several unresolved questions central to criminological inquiry. We then highlight major shortcomings of current empirical approaches and outline several methodological improvements that would enhance our capacity to describe and explain crime trends.},

Three different types of visualization are discussed: theory pictures, visual sketches, and theorizing diagrams. Theory pictures summarize a theory that has already been developed. Visual sketches are used for early attempts to theorize; they are then typically discarded and replaced by new sketches. Theorizing diagrams draw on ideas from Charles Sanders Peirce and can be described as visual representations that are used to generate new theories. Examples are supplied.},

Individual-based models provide relatively weak explanatory power, but models that took a more crime-speciﬁc focus indicated some strength.

	abstract = {Research summary Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) is an increasingly popular violence and gun crime prevention program which aims to identify prolific violent offenders, and deter or incapacitate them from offending. While PSN programs generally show moderate effects on violence and gun crime reduction, questions remain about the magnitude and duration of effects given the heterogeneity in treatment applications across PSN programs. This study presents a quasi-experimental evaluation of a cutting-edge PSN initiative on violence and gun crime in Tampa, Florida over a 6-year period. Results indicate that PSN was associated with a 24.4\% raw reduction in violence (d = −0.16) and a 24.0\% reduction in gun crime rates (d = −0.22) for the treatment agency, while the control groups saw much smaller decreases in violence and gun crime over the same time period. Policy implications There are several policy implications, as PSN is currently endorsed by the U.S. Department of Justice to combat violence and gun crime, with billions spent to support these programs across the nation. First, this study suggests that the use of an objective scoring criteria comprised a multi-faceted array of evidence-based risk factors to identify the prolific offenders subject to the PSN intervention yields a notable effect on violence and gun crime reduction and unlike other PSN initiatives, this program benefits from not being reliant on more subjective or sweeping approaches to identify potential prolific offenders. Second, this approach was associated with substantial decreases in violence and gun crime over the 3-year follow-up period, but importantly, total arrests in the treatment jurisdiction also decreased. This has potential positive effects for police-community relations, and perceptions of police legitimacy and effectiveness. Finally, the crime reductions in this evaluation were estimated to prevent more than 250 victims of violence and gun crime, and provide support for a new approach for PSN initiatives to replicate in research and practice.},

In this paper, we investigate one potential explanation for this dramatic and unexpected improvement in public safety — the New York Police Department’s shift to a more surgical form of “precision policing”, in which law enforcement focuses resources on a small number of individuals who are thought to be the primary drivers of violence. We study New York City’s campaign of “gang takedowns” in which suspected members of criminal gangs were arrested in highly coordinated raids and prosecuted on conspiracy charges. We show that gun violence in and around public housing communities fell by approximately one third in the first year after a gang takedown. Our estimates imply that gang takedowns explain nearly one quarter of the decline in gun violence in New York City’s public housing communities over the last eight years.},

In particular, we test for both the potential effect of disorder on violence as well as how changes in violent crime rates can impact neighborhood levels of disorder. We control for a variety of factors related to social disorganization theory that can lead to crime and potentially disorder. In order to disentangle these relationships, we use a cross-lagged auto-regressive structural equation model and a unique dataset comprised of calls for police service and reported incidents for 117 neighborhoods in Reno, NV. We ﬁnd that higher rates of disorder lead to signiﬁcant, but modest, increases in violent crime, but only aggravated assaults lead to increases in disorder. These effects hold true above and beyond the effect of social disorganization and the inﬂuence of spatially proximate neighborhoods.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Examine changes in officer behavior, when wearing body-worn cameras, as revealed by pedestrian stops, vehicle stops, arrests, use of force, and citizen complaints during a pilot implementation in a racially diverse jurisdiction in the Northeast region of the USA.

Methods
A quasi-experimental approach was used to examine the initial implementation of body-worn cameras (BWCs) in one district. This provided the opportunity for a natural experiment comparing officers in the district that deployed cameras with officers in three similar districts where no BWCs were deployed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match BWC officers with non-BWC officers.

Results
BWC officers had about 38.3\% fewer use of force incidents than non-BWC officers with similar numbers of use of force incidents in the previous year. On average, BWC officers made 46.4\% fewer pedestrian stops and 39.2\% fewer arrests than non-BWC officers. Vehicle stops and citizen complaints had nonsignificant declines for BWC officers.

Conclusions
The reductions in proactive policing by officers are consistent with a deterrence-based view that officers respond to the increased scrutiny by curtailing interactions with citizens, which in turn, limits the potential for conflict and for police supervisors to identify behavior worthy of disciplinary action. The lack of a significant reduction in citizen complaints supports the view that the effect of BWCs on negative officer behavior is contingent upon other factors in the settings in which cameras are deployed. Future research should examine the impacts of cameras on the narrowing of police discretion because of the important implications for police–community relations.},

	abstract = {Methods: Psychometric instrument development study conducted in England using convenience samples. Forty-ﬁve items were selected for the OOKS organised in four sub-scales (risks, signs, actions and naloxone use). The OOAS was formed initially of 32 items grouped in three sub-scales (competence, concerns and readiness). Both scales were administered to 42 friends and family members of heroin users and 56 healthcare professionals to assess internal reliability and construct validity. The Brief Overdose Recognition and Response Assessment (BORRA) and the General Self-Efﬁcacy Scale (GSE) were also administered to family members to test concurrent validity. Family members completed the OOKS and OOAS on a second occasion to assess test–retest reliability.
Results: The OOKS and OOAS were internally reliable (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83 and 0.90, respectively). Retest was completed by 33 participants after 14 (SD 7) days (OOKS, ICC = 0.90 and OOAS, ICC = 0.82) with sub-scale item sets from each measure falling within the fair-to-excellent range (ICC = 0.53–0.92). Professionals reported signiﬁcantly higher scores on both scales than family members. The OOKS total score was positively correlated with the BORRA’s Overdose Recognition (r = 0.5, P {\textless} 0.01) and Naloxone Indication sub-scales (r = 0.44, P {\textless} 0.05), but the total score on the OOAS was not associated with the GSE (r = 0.02, NS).
Conclusion: The 45-item OOKS and 28-item OOAS are suitable as outcome measures of take-home naloxone training for friends and family members of opioid users. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Training law enforcement ofﬁcers (LEOs) to administer naloxone to opioid overdose victims is increasingly part of comprehensive efforts to reduce opioid overdose deaths. Such efforts could yield positive interactions between LEOs and community members and might ultimately help lower overdose death rates.
Methods: We evaluated a pilot LEO naloxone program by (1) assessing opioid overdose knowledge and attitudes (competency in responding, concerns about naloxone administration, and attitudes towards overdose victims) before and after a 30 min training on overdose and naloxone administration, and (2) conducting qualitative interviews with LEOs who used naloxone to respond to overdose emergencies after the training.
Results: Eighty-one LEOs provided pre- and post-training data. Nearly all (89\%) had responded to an overdose while serving as an LEO. Statistically signiﬁcant increases were observed in nearly all items measuring opioid overdose knowledge (p’s = 0.04 to {\textless}0.0001). Opioid overdose competencies (p {\textless} 0.001) and concerns about naloxone administration (p {\textless} 0.001) signiﬁcantly improved after the training, while there was no change in attitudes towards overdose victims (p = 0.90). LEOs administered naloxone 11 times; nine victims survived and three of the nine surviving victims made at least one visit to substance abuse treatment as a result of a LEO-provided referral. Qualitative data suggest that LEOs had generally positive experiences when they employed the skills from the training.
Conclusions: Training LEOs in naloxone administration can increase knowledge and conﬁdence in managing opioid overdose emergencies. Perhaps most importantly, training LEOs to respond to opioid overdose emergencies may have positive effects for LEOs and overdose victims.},

Implementation of syringe access programs has sometimes been complicated by community opposition and police interference. Case description: In 2006, the Delaware legislature authorized a pilot syringe exchange program (SEP). A program designed to prevent, monitor, and respond to possible policing and community barriers before they had a chance to effect program implementation and operation. A program designed to prevent, monitor, and respond to these barriers was planned and implemented by a multidisciplinary team of legal practitioners and public health professionals. Discussion: We report on an integrated intervention to address structural barriers to syringe exchange program utilization. This intervention employs community, police and client education combined with systematic surveillance of and rapid response to police interference to preempt the kinds of structural barriers to implementation observed elsewhere. The intervention addresses community concerns and stresses the benefits of syringe exchange programs to officer occupational safety. Conclusions: A cohesive effort combining collaboration with and educational outreach to police and community members based on the needs and concerns of these groups as well as SEP clients and potential clients helped establish a supportive street environment for the SEP. Police-driven structural barriers to implementation of public health programs targeting populations engaged in drug use and other illicit behavior can be addressed by up-stream planning, prevention, monitoring and intervention strategies. More research is needed to inform the tailoring of interventions to address police-driven barriers to HIV prevention services, especially among marginalized populations.},

	abstract = {Background: One approach to reduce fatal opioid overdose is by distributing naloxone to law enforcement ofﬁcers. While several cities have implemented these naloxone programs, little research has investigated ofﬁcer attitudes about their training. The present research attempts to ﬁll this gap by analyzing survey data from police ofﬁcers following intranasal naloxone training.
Methods: All of the police ofﬁcers within the same district in Indianapolis, Indiana, underwent training to recognize opioid overdose and to administer intranasal naloxone (N = 117). Following training, ofﬁcers completed a survey that measured prior experience with opioid overdose, perceived importance of training, and items from the Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS) to measure attitudes following training.
Results: The ofﬁcers had overwhelmingly positive feelings about the training, that it was not difﬁcult, and that other ofﬁcers should be trained to use naloxone. The OOAS items suggest that ofﬁcers know the appropriate actions to take in the event of an overdose and feel that administering intranasal naloxone will not be difﬁcult. Finally, we found that ofﬁcers who had more experience with opioid overdose had more positive attitudes about the training.
Conclusion: Distributing naloxone to police ofﬁcers is likely a trend that will continue so it is important to understand how police ofﬁcers respond to training to assure that future trainings are as effective as possible. Further research is needed to investigate the impact that these programs have on the community.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study sought to answer the question, “Can police ofﬁcers administer intranasal naloxone to drug overdose victims to decrease the opioid overdose death rate?”
Methods: This prospective interventional study was conducted in Lorain County, OH, from January 2011 to October 2014. Starting October 2013, trained police ofﬁcers administered naloxone to suspected opioid overdose victims through a police ofﬁcer naloxone prescription program (NPP). Those found by the county coroner to be positive for opioids at the time of death and those who received naloxone from police ofﬁcers were included in this study. The rate of change in the total number of opioid-related deaths in Lorain County per quarter year, before and after initiation of the NPP, and the trend in the survival rate of overdose victims who were given naloxone were analyzed by linear regression. Signiﬁcance was established a priori at P b .05.
Results: Data from 247 individuals were eligible for study inclusion. Opioid overdose deaths increased signiﬁcantly before initiation of the police ofﬁcer NPP with average deaths per quarter of 5.5 for 2011, 15.3 for 2012, and 16.3 for the ﬁrst 9 months of 2013. After initiation of the police ofﬁcer NPP, the number of opioid overdose deaths decreased each quarter with an overall average of 13.4. Of the 67 participants who received naloxone by police ofﬁcers, 52 (77.6\%) survived, and 8 (11.9\%) were lost to follow-up.
Conclusions: Intranasal naloxone administration by police ﬁrst responders is associated with decreased deaths in opioid overdose victims.},

	abstract = {Background: Opioid intoxication and overdoses are life-threatening emergencies requiring rapid treatment. One response to this has been to train law enforcement to detect the signs of an opioid overdose and train them to administer naloxone to reverse the effects. Although not a new concept, few studies have attempted to examine this policy. Methods: At 4 different locations in Indiana, law enforcement personnel were trained to detect the signs of an opioid-related overdose and how to administer naloxone to reverse the effects of the overdose. Pre and post surveys were administered at each location (N D 97). To examine changes in attitudes following training, the authors included items from the Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS), which measures respondents’ competency, concerns, and readiness to administer naloxone. Results: Among the full sample, naloxone training resulted in signiﬁcant increases in competency, concerns, and readiness. Examining changes in attitudes by each location revealed that the training had the greatest effect on competency to administer naloxone and in easing concerns that law enforcement personal might have in administering naloxone. Conclusions: This study adds to others in showing that law enforcement personnel are receptive to naloxone training and that the OOAS is able to capture these attitudes. This study advances this literature by examining pre-post changes across multiple locations. As the distribution of naloxone continues to proliferate, this study and the OOAS may be valuable towards the development of an evidence-based training model for law enforcement.},

The current opioid epidemic now poses one of the country’s most serious medical challenges. The dramatic climb in opioid overdose deaths in the United States paralleled the booming legal market in prescription opioids. More than 100 Americans, on average, die each day from opioid overdose. Since 2000, the number of overdose deaths from opioids has quadrupled to nearly half a million people. Naloxone administration among law enforcement oﬃcers has been gaining momentum. Throughout the country, law enforcement agencies have been initiating overdose reversal programs to stem the rising tide of deaths from opioids. As of March 2018, a total of 2,300 law enforcement agencies in 42 states reported that they administered a naloxone rescue program.},

However, there have been strong oppositions to the idea of the police Narcan use. Still, in 2018, the nation is debating about it. Though not clearly visible to the public, there are important ethical arguments against the police Narcan use which necessarily involve understanding of the ethical roles and responsibilities of police as the law enforcement agency and apprehension of the moral status of a non-therapeutic opioid use. The authors of the paper investigate, primarily, the existing ethical controversies surrounding the police Narcan use while touching upon the issue of the decriminalizing drug policy in the U.S. The authors conclude that the police can carry and administer Narcan without self-contradiction and that the policymakers’ investigation on the drug decriminalization policy should begin with the understanding of the “common morality” of the American public, the ethical view shared and practiced by the greatest number of people.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Drug overdose is a significant public health problem, yet little is known about racial/ethnic differences in drug overdose rates and/or in responses to a drug overdose following naloxone administration. This paper examines differences in rates of survivorship, response, revival and administration of naloxone by race and ethnicity among those who experienced a drug overdose in Pennsylvania between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Spatio-temporal variations in drug overdose locations were examined to facilitate understanding of service development, planning, and delivery of effective treatment need.
Methods: Ten thousand two hundred and ninety drug overdose incidents were analyzed from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network (ODIN). The ODIN is a centralized repository that contains information on drug overdoses victims including age, gender and race/ethnicity, naloxone administrations and survivorship, drug(s) suspected of causing the overdose, victim outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and arrests) and average naloxone dosage per victim. Between group differences were tested using χ2 -tests of independence. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of survivorship according to victim characteristics. All statistical analyses and mapping were performed using the R statistical programming environment.
Results: About eighty-seven percent of drug overdose response victims were white, and seventy-one percent were between the ages of 20–39. White females were more likely to receive an overdose response compared to black or Hispanic females. A non-opioid was indicated more frequently in overdoses involving black victims compared to either whites or Latinos. Latinos and blacks were more likely to survive a drug overdose. However, following naloxone administration, no racial or ethnic differences in survivorship were noted. Differences in responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following the drug overdose event were also found. Finally, overdoses among Blacks and Latinos demonstrated a stronger spatial patterning across counties compared to whites.
Conclusions: This study found a significant, disparate impact of race/ethnicity on fatal drug overdoses when naloxone is not administered. Further, individuals who were administered naloxone and subsequently received medical care in a hospital experienced lower drug-related mortality, suggesting that first responders are critical intervention points for individuals in need of medical treatment following a drug overdose. However, while naloxone administration is a necessary first step in the recovery process, longitudinal pathways towards treatment are critical to stem the drug overdose crisis.},

	abstract = {Opioid overdoses are an important public health concern. Concerns about police involvement at overdose events may decrease calls to 911 for emergency medical care thereby increasing the chances than an overdose becomes fatal. To address this concern, Washington State passed a law that provides immunity from drug possession charges and facilitates the availability of take-home-naloxone (the opioid overdose antidote) to bystanders in 2010. To examine the knowledge and opinions regarding opioid overdoses and this new law, police (n=251) and paramedics (n=28) in Seattle, WA were surveyed. The majority of police (64 \%) and paramedics (89 \%) had been at an opioid overdose in the prior year. Few officers (16 \%) or paramedics (7 \%) were aware of the new law. While arrests at overdose scenes were rare, drugs or paraphernalia were confiscated at 25 \% of the most recent overdoses police responded to. Three quarters of officers felt it was important they were at the scene of an overdose to protect medical personnel, and a minority, 34 \%, indicated it was important they were present for the purpose of enforcing laws. Police opinions about the immunity and naloxone provisions of the law were split, and we present a summary of the reasons for their opinions. The results of this survey were utilized in public health efforts by the police department which developed a roll call training video shown to all patrol officers. Knowledge of the law was low, and opinions of it were mixed; however, police were concerned about the issue of opioid overdose and willing to implement agency-wide training.},

Yet, the question remains, are estimates of violent crime prevalence and location distorted from a unilateral reliance on police data? Here, we examine whether emergency medical service (EMS) data collected by the fire department are spatially concentrated in the same way as police data and whether these data can help identify instances of violence unreported to police in the city of Seattle between 2009 and 2011. We find high levels of concentration in both police and EMS data and evidence that new information is learned about the location of violence problems from utilizing multiple data sources. Overall, these findings contribute to a small but growing body of work that demonstrates the utility of nonconventional data in the identification of crime and harm concentrations of interest.},

	abstract = {Over the past twenty years, many US cities have seen urban revitalization and population changes associated with an increased desire for urban living among the affluent. As inner-city neighborhoods become gentrified, they are more likely to witness the construction of new buildings and homes, the conversion of industrial spaces to mixed-used developments, expanded access to mass transit, and the arrival of coffee shops and other urban amenities. In this review, we take stock of what is known about the impact of gentrification and land-use changes on neighborhood crime. We summarize research conducted since the period of urban revitalization that started in the 1990s as well as studies that have a quasi-experimental design. We find that gentrification and associated changes to land use tend to reduce crime in neighborhoods. Our findings are tempered by the need for greater conceptual clarity on how to measure when a neighborhood has gentrified and a clearer examination of the spatial displacement of crime. We conclude with a discussion on the need for criminologists to partner with urban planners to study how changes in the land use of cities can be made to generate crime reductions that benefit all places and, finally, detail some promising directions for future research.},

This paper identifies and metaanalyzes the evidence for three mechanisms (pathways) by which neighborhood disorder is argued to impact health, accounting for methodological inconsistencies across studies. A search identified 198 studies (152 with sufficient data for meta-analysis) testing any of the three pathways or downstream, general health outcomes. The meta-analysis found that perceived disorder was consistently associated with mental health outcomes, as well as substance abuse, and measures of overall health. This supported the psychosocial model of disadvantage, in which stressful contexts impact mental health and related sequelae. There was no consistent evidence for disorder's impact on physical health or risky behavior. Further examination revealed that support for BWT-related hypotheses has been overstated owing to data censoring and the failure to consistently include critical covariates, like socioeconomic status and collective efficacy. Even where there is evidence that BWT impacts outcomes, it is driven by studies that measured disorder as the perceptions of the focal individual, potentially conflating pessimism about the neighborhood with mental health.},

During the study period (2005-2007), 431 crimes were reported at the 2,813 single-family homes in our sample. In general, the authors find that trees in the public right of way are associated with lower crime rates. The relationship between crime and trees on a house’s lot is mixed. Smaller, view-obstructing trees are associ­ ated with increased crime, whereas larger trees are associated with reduced crime. The authors speculate that trees may reduce crime by signaling to potential criminals that a house is better cared for and, therefore, subject to more effective authority than a comparable house with fewer trees.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the inter-related concepts of sustainable urban development and CPTED (crime prevention through environmental design). It argues that a ‘safer’ and ‘sustainable’ community must be characterised by the image of regulation, or at least some control of real and imagined threats to personal or community health and the threat of crime and personal attack. Planners and urban designers have a growing awareness and experience of ‘sustainable development’ and are beginning to consider the capacity of the built environment to reduce both the fear of crime and the potential for offending. This paper concludes that a synthesis of the two concepts can represent a meaningful contribution towards crafting an effective strand of ‘urban environmentalism’ that can be utilised to facilitate the design of safer, more liveable and sustainable urban communities.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The concept of territoriality, for example, is central to the practice domain of CPTED. Yet territoriality is only vaguely defined within that domain, as are the other core concepts such as activity support and target hardening; and all of them confusingly intersect and overlap. The paper attempts a remedy by developing a suite of definitions in depth, relating the core concepts to various frameworks and discourses developed for crime prevention and design against crime, and more generally exploring ways in which CPTED could become richer and more subtle. It will also consider the ‘dark side’ of the environment, covering offenders’ countermoves to prevention and their own counter-exploitation of space, buildings and what they contain. The ultimate intention is to produce a more rigorous, yet deeper and better-integrated conception of CPTED useful for practice, research and theory alike. The paper should be considered as work in progress, indicating what might be possible and stimulating debate rather than offering a definitive resolution of the issue. Further steps are suggested and constructive contributions from readers are invited.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) approach in reducing robberies.
Methods: CPTED evaluations were obtained through a comprehensive search mechanism. Two sets of inclusion criteria were used: 16 primary studies evaluated a CPTED program with a comparison period; 12 secondary studies presented some evidence of CPTED effects but were not required to have the same level of scientiﬁc rigor. The percentage change in pre- and post-intervention events was the outcome examined. Studies were stratiﬁed by programs implementing multiple components, a single component, and through ordinances. Main
Results: All primary multiple-component CPTED programs experienced a percentage change in robberies ranging from Ϫ84\% to Ϫ30\%. Single-component program effects ranged from Ϫ83\% to ϩ91\%, and ordinances ranged from Ϫ65\% to ϩ130\%. Secondary studies reported robbery changes ranging between Ϫ92\% and ϩ7.6\%. Robbery reductions were larger for interventions comprising basic store design, cash control, and training components compared to those including equipment systems. No associations were found between robbery decreases and either the follow-up period or the number of program components. Studies examining nonfatal injuries found a median pre-post change of Ϫ61\%; those examining homicides found changes ranging from 0\% to ϩ11\%.
Conclusions: The broad nature of the CPTED approach allows its adaptation to any setting, and results indicate that it is an effective approach to reducing robbery. However, most interventions were not evaluated independently of other factors contributing to robbery risk. More research is needed on individual components and effects in various business settings.},

Reynald (Crime Prevention and Community Safety: An International Journal, 11(1):1-20, 2009, Journal of Research in Crime \& Delinquency, 2010b) demonstrated that supervision or natural surveillance is one of the core dimensions of active guardianship in residential areas. This paper will begin with an illustration of how the CPTED principles are translated into crime preventive action in residential environments by using observational data to get a first-hand look at how CPTED functions in practice. The paper will then go on to combine these field observations with interview data from residents themselves to show the ways in which opportunities for the CPTED component of surveillance are affected, not simply by the design of the physical environment, but also by the context in which the opportunities exist. These results will be used to critically reflect on some inherent conflicts and points of neglect in the relationship between the components of surveillance, territoriality and image/maintenance, as a means of airing some of the conceptual and practical weaknesses that may serve to limit the existing CPTED model.},

	url = {https://osf.io/9hwv7},
	abstract = {The mission of American policing is “to protect and serve,” but recent events suggest that many Americans, and especially Black Americans, do not feel protected from the police. Understanding policing-related emotions is vital not only because they are at the heart of the United States’ police legitimacy crisis, but also because they may have far-reaching effects on citizens’ lives. We measured personal and altruistic fear of the police in a nationwide sample of Americans (N = 1,150), which included comparable numbers of Blacks (N = 517) and Whites (N = 492). Most Whites felt safe, but most Blacks feared the police even more than crime, being afraid both for themselves and for others they cared about. The racial divide in fear was mediated by past experiences with police mistreatment. In turn, fear mediated the effects of race and past mistreatment on support for defunding the police and intentions to have “the talk” with family youths about the need to distrust and avoid officers. A Rawlsian cost-benefit analysis revealed that about half of Blacks would rather be the victim of a serious crime than be questioned or searched by the police. Taken together, the findings indicate that when it comes to the police, Blacks and Whites live in different emotional worlds, one of fear and the other of felt safety. This deep racial divide in fear represents a racially disparate health crisis, a breach of the social contract in which the state promises protection in exchange for compliance, and a primary obstacle to law enforcement’s capacity to serve all communities equitably. Acknowledging and reducing Blacks’ fear is essential to resolving the police legitimacy crisis in the United States.},

In many disadvantaged communities of color, poor relationships between the police and residents undermine effective policing. Weak police–minority community relationships are rooted in a long history of discriminatory practices and contemporary proactive policing strategies that are overly aggressive and associated with racial disparities. There are no simple solutions to address the complex rift between the police and the minority communities that they serve. The available evidence suggests that there are policies and practices that could improve police–minority community relations and enhance police effectiveness. Police departments should conduct more sophisticated analysis of crime problems to ensure that crime-control programs are not indiscriminate and unfocused, engage residents in their crime reduction efforts by revitalizing community policing, ensure procedurally just police contacts with citizens, and implement problem-solving strategies to prevent crimes beyond surveillance and enforcement actions.},

	abstract = {How do public sector workers balance their pro-social motivations with private interests? In this study of police oﬃcers, we exploit two institutional features that change the implicit cost of making an arrest: arrests made near the end of an oﬃcer’s shift are more likely to require overtime work, and arrests made on days when an oﬃcer “moonlights” at an oﬀ-duty job after their shift have a higher opportunity cost. We document two consequences for oﬃcer behavior. First, contrary to popular wisdom, oﬃcers reduce arrests near the end of their shift, and the quality of arrests increases. We argue that these patterns are driven by oﬃcer preferences rather than departmental policy, fatigue, or incapacitation from earlier arrests. Second, oﬃcers further reduce late-shift arrests on days in which they moonlight after work, suggesting that they are, in fact, modestly responsive to ﬁnancial incentives. Using these results, we estimate a dynamic model that identiﬁes an oﬃcer’s implied trade-oﬀ between private and pro-social motivations. We ﬁnd that police oﬃcers exhibit high pro-social motivation towards their work. In contrast to prior research showing that law enforcement outcomes are sensitive to ﬁnancial incentives at an institutional level, the behavior of individual oﬃcers — the “street-level bureaucrats” who enforce the law — is not meaningfully distorted by monetary considerations.},

Results indicate that homicide prevention is a critical police responsibility and that by employing problem-oriented strategies and garnering citizen involvement, police may be able to effectively reduce the prevalence of such violence.},

Bayesian structural time-series modeling shows that voluntary resignations increased by 279\% relative to the synthetic control, and the model predicts that resignations will continue at an elevated level. However, retirements and involuntary separations were not significantly affected during the study period. A retention crisis may diminish police departments’ operational capacity to carry out their expected responsibilities.

	abstract = {We report the first empirical estimate of the race-specific effects of larger police forces in the United States. Each additional police officer abates approximately 0.1 homicides. In per capita terms, effects are twice as large for Black versus white victims. At the same time, larger police forces make more arrests for low-level “quality-of-life” offenses, with effects that imply a disproportionate burden for Black Americans. Notably, cities with large Black populations do not share equally in the benefits of investments in police manpower. Our results provide novel empirical support for the popular narrative that Black communities are simultaneously over and under-policed.},

	abstract = {Reducing police misconduct is, in large part, about ﬁnding predictable ex ante risk and reducing it, through a combination of human resource policies and human capital development, as well as having well-functioning accountability and disciplinary systems. This paper discusses ways in which state policymakers can help encourage and support local police departments in these eﬀorts. We begin by discussing what is known about the ability of new “big data” methods to capture predictable risk. We then discuss various ways in which state-level policies can be helpful in improving existing systems, and conclude with thoughts about the highest-priority topics where future research is most desperately needed.},

	abstract = {This article suggests that American municipal police departments are highly institutionalized organizations and should be studied in terms of how their formal structure and activities are shaped by powerful mvths in their institutional environment. The incorporation of powerful myths into the structure and activities of police departments enables them to attain legitimacy; with legitimacy comes stability and protection from outside interference by powerful sovereign actors who are present in the enveloping institutional environment. However, legitimacy problems arising from conflicting institutional myths may precipitate full-blown organizational crises. Such police department crises are resolved ceremonially through a ritual that combines the public degradation of the department and the removal and replacement of the disgraced police chief by a new chief with a "legitimating" mandate.},

Using longitudinal data compiled by killedbypolice.net, we use an interrupted time-series design to test the effect of events in Ferguson on fatal shootings by police. Our analyses reveal that the number of citizens killed by police is temporally unstable, exhibiting random short-term fluctuations that are often misinterpreted as evidence of substantively meaningful trends. However, after testing a variety of model specifications, we find no evidence that the number of fatal police shootings either increased or decreased post-Ferguson. Claims to the contrary are based on weak analyses of short-term trends.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This 100-day experiment explored the impact of a dynamic place-based policing strategy on social harm in Indianapolis. Scholars have recently called for place-based policing to consider the co-occurrence of substance abuse and mental health problems that correlate within crime hot spots. Moreover, severity is not ubiquitous across harmful events and should thus be weighted accordingly.
Methods: Harmspots and hotspots were operationalized for this experiment and both received proactive police activities. Evaluation analyses includes multivariate point processes and hawkes processes to determine exper­ imental effects. Survey data was collected via telephone surveys, was weighted for demographic representa­ tiveness, and analyzed using Poisson regression.
Results: Results indicate proactive policing in dynamic harmspots can reduce aggregated social harm. No sta­ tistical deterrence effect was observed in crime hotspots. Proactive police activity in harmspots was associated with higher arrest rates, though not disproportionate across race and ethnicity, nor was there an effect on in­ cidents of use of force. A two-wave pre/post community survey indicated Indianapolis citizens believe datadriven policing to be useful, though perceptions vary across demographic groups with moderate trust around computer algorithms.
Conclusion: Place-based policing strategies should consider social harm events as a method to operationalize proactive policing. Observed effects are consistent with those of hotspots policing while enabling cities to broaden the set of harms experienced by varying communities. Harmspot policing may also position munici­ palities to maximize social service delivery at places beyond policing.},

	abstract = {The protests following the killing of George Floyd in the summer of 2020 led to contentious discussions and debates in many cities about policing, with some calling to “defund the police.” However, this debate has generally proceeded without adequate research about either the scale or nature of issues that the police handle and the potential consequences of the proposed reform efforts. To respond to this research gap, we analyze millions of 911 calls for service across nine U.S. agencies. We report on the types of calls for service that the police handle, including how frequently different calls arise, how much time agencies spend on different categories of calls, and the outcomes of those calls. We find that the amount and types of incidents for which people call the police are voluminous, with the vast majority not obviously transferable to other organizations or government sectors without significant resource expenditures or adjustments. However, if the police retain these responsibilities, they also need to reconsider how they can more effectively address community concerns.},

	abstract = {Existing research shows that distrust of the police is widespread and consequential for public safety. However, there is a shortage of interventions that demonstrably reduce negative police interactions with the communities they serve. A training program in Chicago attempted to encourage 8,480 officers to adopt procedural justice policing strategies. These strategies emphasize respect, neutrality, and transparency in the exercise of authority, while providing opportunities for civilians to explain their side of events. We find that training reduced complaints against the police by 10.0\% and reduced the use of force against civilians by 6.4\% over 2 y. These findings affirm the feasibility of changing the command and control style of policing which has been associated with popular distrust and the use of force, through a broad training program built around the concept of procedurally just policing.},

	abstract = {Background
Opioid use has emerged as a significant public health crisis in cities across the United States. In Arizona, opioid overdose deaths increased by 65\% from 2016 to 2018, leading the Governor of Arizona to declare a State of Emergency. Because police are often the first to arrive at the scene of an overdose, officers are central to an effective response to the opioid crisis in Arizona and elsewhere. However, many police officers do not carry naloxone, which can immediately reverse the life-threatening effects of an opioid overdose. Few studies examine officer perceptions of opioid use or their willingness to carry and administer naloxone. The degree to which officers accept this public health responsibility remains unclear.
Methods
The authors administered two waves of a survey to patrol officers in the Tempe (AZ) Police Department. The officers completed wave 1 approximately three months before the start of a program that trained and outfitted patrol officers with naloxone. Officers completed wave 2 of the survey several months after the program started. Relying on the Opioid Overdose Knowledge (OOKS), Competence, Concerns, and Attitudes (OOAS) of People who Overdose, and Naloxone-Related Risk Compensation Beliefs (NaRRC-B) scales, the survey captures officer attitudes regarding opioid use, willingness to carry and administer naloxone, and perceptions of their role in responding to the opioid crisis.
Results
At wave 1, officers conveyed moderate levels of confidence in recognizing an overdose and providing life-saving care. Officers indicated strong support for carrying naloxone and responding to opioid overdoses, and they recognized the value of treatment for users. At wave 2, officers reported significantly greater confidence and competence in responding to overdoses, and their support for carrying naloxone also increased. Both before and after program start, there was little variation in attitudes across gender, race/ethnicity, education, and length of service.
Conclusion
Officers accept this public health responsibility as part of their mission. Given that officers are frequently first on scene at overdoses and a matter of seconds can determine life or death, police-led naloxone programs will save lives in Tempe and elsewhere.},
